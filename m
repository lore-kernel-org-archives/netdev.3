Add a shell library for DPLL selftests with wrappers around the iproute2
dpll tool and around the dpllsim configfs interface, and the first two
test scripts built on it. The library resolves devices by the clock ID
chosen at creation time, since netlink ids depend on what else exists
on the system, and the dpllsim helpers restrict the lookup to their
module, so that a device of another driver with the same clock ID is
never picked up. Every query runs the tool first and jq on what it
printed, so that a failed query is told apart from a missing attribute.
That includes the device dump the device selection reads. A dump that
fails is a failure, not a system without a device, unless the simulator
is missing as well, which is what a kernel without the DPLL subsystem
looks like and a skip. The library loads the dpllsim module and mounts
configfs when nothing else did, and the exit trap of each script undoes
the mount, removes the devices the script created and runs on INT and
TERM as well, so that a timeout imposed by the harness still cleans up.
The module stays loaded.

Two runs of scripts that create dpllsim devices would share the one
dpllsim directory and could draw the same clock IDs, so every such
script takes a lock before it mounts or creates anything and skips when
another run holds it. The lock file lives under /run rather than in
/tmp, since the scripts run as root and open the file for writing, and
a symlink planted in the world-writable /tmp would redirect that open.

dpll_basic.sh checks that a device reports the mandatory attributes
over netlink. It runs against the device named by DPLL_DEV_ID, the
first device of the driver named by DPLL_DRIVER, or the first device
that is not a dpllsim one, and creates a dpllsim device when there is
none or when DPLL_DRIVER asks for dpllsim, so the same script serves
the simulator and real drivers and picks one of several drivers on a
host. A simulated device that cannot be created, registered or found on
netlink is a failure, only a missing module is a skip. dpll_stress.sh
is simulator only and exercises the lifecycle paths of the core by
creating and deleting devices in a loop and by cycling one device
through repeated register and unregister transitions. The dpllsim
MAINTAINERS entry covers the new directory.

v4:
- tell a failed device dump from a system without a device, the dump
  is a failure unless the simulator is missing as well
- fail instead of skipping when the simulated device cannot be created,
  registered or found on netlink
- initialize DPLLSIM_CREATED_NAME, so that a value inherited from the
  environment cannot make a cleanup handler delete a device, and never
  record a directory that existed before as a device of the run
- record the configfs mount before mounting, so that a signal handled
  right after the mount still unmounts it
- correct the comments on the side effects of the library and on how it
  is used, drop the shellcheck directive of a function without
  arguments
- add the Reviewed-by given to v3 (Ivan Vecera)

v3:
- move the selftests to tools/testing/selftests/drivers/dpll, next to
  where the drivers live, with the library in that directory as a
  TEST_FILES entry; the TARGETS and MAINTAINERS entries follow
- add DPLL_DRIVER, which picks the first device of the named driver
  or, as dpllsim, a created simulated device on a system that has
  hardware DPLL devices
- the Reviewed-by and Acked-by of v2 are not carried over, the
  device selection changed

v2:
- sort the config file alphabetically (netdev CI check_selftest)
- quote the ksft_skip and ret expansions and add shellcheck directives
  for the globals read by the scripts, for ksft_skip, which comes from
  net/lib.sh, and for the optional argument of
  dpllsim_setup_standard_device() (netdev CI shellcheck)
