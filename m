Or have your CI merge the branches and run on that (that's a fairly
widely deployed approach).

The issue is not your rebase working, the issue is that until you get
round to doing that rebase anyone that merges both bluetooth and the net
trees (ot Linus' tree for that matter, often the conflicts are with his
tree) sees the duplicated commits and that routinely generates
conflicts.  This obviously comes up an awful lot with -next, I am not
rebasing the trees but rather merging them, but do I gather from some
conversations that other people are seeing this as part of their
workflows.

Anyway, to return to my prior question: should you be a contact for the
bluetooth tree?
