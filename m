I just skimmed this, and it seems like it needs some scrutiny on the
cleanup side. The LLM flagged a few cleanup issues. Could you check
these paths?

  | main() only restores shared state on the normal path. Exceptions
  | during setup can leave RSS, steering rules or hugepage reservations
  | changed. Would a run-scoped ExitStack help here?
  |
  | _steer_udp() enables ntuple filtering before recording its original
  | state. If rule insertion fails, that change isn't tracked.
  |
  | _unsteer_udp() stops on the first error, leaving subsequent cleanup
  | undone.
  |
  | _run() waits for the remote in finally, but doesn't ensure the local
  | endpoint is stopped/reaped if its wait is interrupted.
  |
  | The fallback cleanup restores XDP/MTU, but not ring sizes after an
  | endpoint is killed.
  |
  | "-X default" resets RSS rather than restoring the original table.
  |
  | An unconditional SKIP when either endpoint skips can hide a genuine
  | failure on the other endpoint, including a crash or cleanup failure.

The defer ordering itself looks sensible: detach XDP before restoring
the MTU.
