net: skbuff: don't BUG() on leftover length in skb_copy_and_csum_bits()

This patch replaces the BUG_ON(len) at the end of skb_copy_and_csum_bits()
with a DEBUG_NET_WARN_ON_ONCE(). It zero-fills the part of the destination
buffer that was not copied and returns a checksum of 0, so a short copy
should not crash and should not leave stale bytes in the buffer.

> It can't just return, though.  Its callers copy into a buffer that is
> about to go out on the wire, an ICMP error quoting the offending packet
> for example, so bailing out early would send whatever was left in the
> rest of that buffer.

[Severity: Low]
Does this hold for every caller? xdr_skb_read_bits() in
net/sunrpc/socklib.c is on the receive path. It copies a received UDP skb
into RPC receive buffers:

net/sunrpc/socklib.c:xdr_skb_read_bits() {
    ...
		csum = skb_copy_and_csum_bits(desc->skb, desc->offset, to, len);
		desc->csum = csum_block_add(desc->csum, csum, desc->offset);
    ...
}

With this change, that path would put zeros in the RPC receive buffer and
get a partial checksum of 0. Only the later check in
csum_partial_copy_to_xdr() rejects the result:

	if (csum_fold(desc.csum))
		return -1;

This is still better than BUG(). Could the commit message also mention that
receive-side callers are affected?

[Severity: High]
Does this cover every short-copy exit in skb_copy_and_csum_bits()? Right
after the linear head copy, the function still has:

	if (!skb_frags_readable(skb))
		return 0;

That exit leaves the remaining len bytes at to unwritten. So the stale-bytes
case the commit message describes can still happen in this function.

As one example, take an ICMP error that quotes a header-split skb with
unreadable (devmem) frags, where only the headers are in the linear area.
__icmp_send() caps the quote by skb->len and room, not by skb_headlen():

	icmp_param->data_len = icmp_param->skb->len - icmp_param->offset;
	if (icmp_param->data_len > room)
		icmp_param->data_len = room;

The call chain would then be:

__icmp_send()
  ip_append_data()
    __ip_append_data()        /* reserves non-zeroed skb data */
      icmp_glue_bits()
        skb_copy_and_csum_bits()
          if (!skb_frags_readable(skb))
                  return 0;

icmp_glue_bits() uses the return value only as a checksum and reports
success. icmp_push_reply() then calls ip_push_pending_frames().

Could this send several hundred bytes of uninitialized skb head memory on
the wire in the ICMP quote?

The frag_list recursion seems to have the same gap. If skb_gro_receive()
chains an unreadable skb onto frag_list, the recursive call returns 0
without writing anything:

			csum2 = skb_copy_and_csum_bits(frag_iter,
						       offset - start,
						       to, copy);

The outer loop still does len -= copy and to += copy, so the new memset()
at the end never covers that slice.

The unreadable early return predates this patch. It came from commit
65249feb6b3d ("net: add support for skbs with unreadable frags"). However,
the new comment and the commit message's "either way it carries nothing it
shouldn't" both depend on that exit being handled too.

skb_checksum() treats the same condition as an error:

	if (WARN_ON_ONCE(!skb_frags_readable(skb)))
		return 0;

Would it make sense to send the unreadable exit through the same guarded
zero-fill, for example with a shared label? That would also cover the
frag_list recursion, since each recursive call would zero its own slice.
