net: stmmac: drop split frames on AF_XDP zero-copy RX

In stmmac_rx_zc(), when the 1:1 XSK mapping check drops a non-last
descriptor, this patch now marks the frame as errored. The rest of the
split frame is then drained, and its tail is no longer handled as a new
frame. The patch also makes the legacy enhanced and normal descriptor
callbacks report rx_not_ls together with discard_frame, and changes the
discard test in stmmac_rx_zc() and stmmac_rx() from == to &.

[Severity: Low]

With this change and the matching one in ndesc_get_rx_status(), does
stmmac_rx_zc() now count the same split frame differently depending on
the descriptor format?

On dwmac4 and xgmac, dwmac4_wrback_get_rx_status() and
dwxgmac2_get_rx_status() return a bare rx_not_ls for a non-last
descriptor:

	if (likely(!(rdes3 & RDES3_LAST_DESCRIPTOR)))
		return rx_not_ls;

So the frame reaches the new 1:1 mapping drop and rx_dropped is
incremented once.

On dwmac100/dwmac1000, non-last descriptors now carry discard_frame. The
status & discard_frame block in stmmac_rx_zc() runs first and increments
rx_errors for each non-last descriptor (when hwts_rx_en is off). The new
rx_dropped++ in the 1:1 path is never reached on these cores.

An N-descriptor jumbo frame would then show up as 1 rx_dropped on
GMAC4/XGMAC, but as N-1 rx_errors on dwmac1000. Both counters are
exported through stmmac_get_stats64(). Is this asymmetry intended?

The legacy cores already counted rx_errors per descriptor before this
patch; what is new is the different rx_dropped accounting. Later in the
series, "net: stmmac: rework stmmac_rx to support XDP rx multi-buff"
changes stmmac_rx() to test !error && (status & discard_frame), so it
counts once per frame. stmmac_rx_zc() still counts per descriptor at the
end of the series.

[Severity: Low]

Can one split frame on dwmac4/XGMAC now be counted in both rx_dropped and
rx_errors?

The first non-last descriptor takes this path, which increments
rx_dropped and sets error = 1. Suppose the last descriptor of the same
frame then reports discard_frame (RDES3_ERROR_SUMMARY, for example a CRC
or giant error on an oversized frame). The earlier block in
stmmac_rx_zc() still runs:

		if (unlikely(status & discard_frame)) {
			error = 1;
			if (!priv->hwts_rx_en)
				rx_errors++;
		}

This happens even though error is already set for this frame.
stmmac_get_stats64() exports both totals as rx_dropped and rx_errors.

Later in the series, "net: stmmac: rework stmmac_rx to support XDP rx
multi-buff" avoids this in stmmac_rx() by testing !error && (status &
discard_frame). stmmac_rx_zc() is not changed, so the double count is
still there at the end of the series.

[Severity: Medium]

This is a pre-existing issue and was not introduced by this patch. The
new rx_dropped++ feeds this accumulation at the end of stmmac_rx_zc():

	priv->xstats.rx_dropped += rx_dropped;
	priv->xstats.rx_errors += rx_errors;

These are plain unsigned long fields in struct stmmac_extra_stats,
shared by the whole device. Each RX channel has its own NAPI instance,
so stmmac_rx_zc() and stmmac_rx() can run at the same time for different
queues on different CPUs.

Can these non-atomic read-modify-writes lose updates?
stmmac_get_stats64() also reads the fields without any synchronization.

stmmac_rx() does the same accumulation, and it is unchanged at the end
of the series.

[Severity: Low]

Changing == to & here and in stmmac_rx_zc() also changes the normal RX
path on dwmac4/GMAC4/GMAC5. Should the commit message mention this?

dwmac4_wrback_get_rx_status() sets ret = discard_frame when
RDES3_ERROR_SUMMARY is set. It then ORs in csum_none for IP header or
payload errors:

	if (rdes1 & RDES1_IP_HDR_ERROR) {
		x->ip_hdr_err++;
		ret |= csum_none;
	}

So a frame with both an L2 error and an IP checksum error reports
discard_frame | csum_none.

Before this patch, such a frame failed the == test. It was run through
XDP and passed to napi_gro_receive() with CHECKSUM_NONE. Now it is
dropped and counted in rx_errors.

The new behaviour looks correct. It stops errored frames from reaching
the stack, which has been possible since commit 644b8437ccef9e ("net:
stmmac: dwmac4: report Rx checksum errors in status").

However, the commit message presents the operator change only as a
result of the enh_desc/norm_desc normalization, and limits the scope to
AF_XDP zero-copy. Could it describe this GMAC4 change and reference
644b8437ccef9e?

[Severity: High]

This isn't a bug introduced by this patch. The commit message says the
change lets stmmac_rx() drain split frames, which holds for
dwmac100/dwmac1000.

GMAC4/XGMAC report non-last descriptors as a bare rx_not_ls. On those
cores, with an XDP program attached, are there still paths in
stmmac_rx() that drop a non-last descriptor without setting error?

When the XDP verdict is STMMAC_XDP_CONSUMED:

				if (xdp_res & STMMAC_XDP_CONSUMED) {
					...
					skb = NULL;

					if (unlikely((status & rx_not_ls)))
						goto read_again;

error is still 0 here, so the next fragment goes through XDP as a new
frame. With a 1-3 byte tail, wouldn't buf1_len -= ETH_FCS_LEN underflow?

For XDP_TX/XDP_REDIRECT:

				} else if (xdp_res & (STMMAC_XDP_TX |
						      STMMAC_XDP_REDIRECT)) {
					xdp_status |= xdp_res;
					buf->page = NULL;
					goto next;
				}

goto next clears in_progress even when rx_not_ls is set. The loop head
then resets error and len, and the tail is reparsed with len == 0.

When napi_build_skb() fails:

				rx_dropped++;
				count++;
				goto drain_data;

error is not set here either, so a later descriptor can build an skb from
only the end of the frame.

This is the same class of bug the patch fixes in stmmac_rx_zc(). An
on-link peer can trigger it, since GMAC_CONFIG_JE is always set on
GMAC4.

It looks like later patches in the same series fix it: "net: stmmac:
drop multi-buffer frames in XDP mode" and "net: stmmac: rework stmmac_rx
to support XDP rx multi-buff". After those, XDP and stmmac_build_skb()
only run on the last descriptor, and failures go to error_free_frag.
