net/rds: split connection destroy into quiesce and kref-governed free

This patch adds a kref to struct rds_connection and splits rds_conn_destroy()
into a synchronous quiesce plus a deferred free (rds_conn_destroy_fini()) that
runs when the last reference is dropped.  rds_conn_get()/rds_conn_put() are
exported and a new one-shot c_destroy_in_prog test under rds_conn_lock makes
repeated destroy calls return early.  No Link: tags are present in the commit
header.

A few questions below.

[Severity: High]

This isn't a leak introduced by this patch - the old rds_conn_path_destroy()
already had the same !cp->cp_transport_data early return ahead of
destroy_workqueue() - but the patch moves destroy_workqueue() into
rds_conn_path_free(), reached from a freshly recomputed npaths loop, so it may
be worth addressing here.  Does this leak the per-path workqueues of a
loopback-converted connection?

__rds_conn_create() computes npaths from the incoming transport:

net/rds/connection.c:__rds_conn_create() {
	int npaths = (trans->t_mp_capable ? RDS_MPATH_WORKERS : 1);
	...
}

For an outgoing RDS/TCP connection to a local address that is 8, and 8 ordered
workqueues get allocated:

	for (i = 0; i < npaths; i++) {
		...
		conn->c_path[i].cp_wq =
			alloc_ordered_workqueue("krds_cp_wq#%lu/%d", 0,
						rds_conn_count, i);

But trans is replaced before it is stored in conn->c_trans:

			if (likely(is_outgoing)) {
				...
				trans = &rds_loop_transport;

rds_loop_transport has t_mp_capable == 0, so both rds_conn_destroy() and the
new rds_conn_destroy_fini() recompute npaths as 1 and only visit path 0.  And
even if paths 1..7 were visited, rds_loop_conn_alloc() sets cp_transport_data
only on path 0, so rds_conn_path_free() would take the !cp->cp_transport_data
return before reaching destroy_workqueue().  kfree(conn->c_path) then drops
the last pointers to the remaining 7 workqueues, once per destroyed
connection, on every netns teardown (rds_loop_kill_conns()) or module unload
(rds_loop_exit()).

For contrast, the allocation rollback in __rds_conn_create() iterates the
entry-time npaths and destroys every workqueue that is not rds_wq.  Should the
teardown path use the same bound, e.g. by recording npaths in the connection?

[Severity: Medium]

Is the protocol-version-mismatch example still reachable?  The changelog says:

    "Today, connections are also destroyed on network namespace teardown
    (rds_tcp_kill_sock() and rds_loop_kill_conns()) and, one at a time,
    when a peer negotiates an unsupported protocol version
    (rds_ib_cm_connect_complete())."

In this tree that branch drops the connection rather than destroying it:

net/rds/ib_cm.c:rds_ib_cm_connect_complete() {
	...
	if (conn->c_version < RDS_PROTOCOL_VERSION) {
		...
		rds_conn_drop(conn);
		return;
	}
	...
}

git grep rds_conn_destroy net/rds/ finds call sites only in ib_rdma.c
(rds_ib_destroy_nodev_conns), loop.c and tcp.c - none in ib_cm.c.  Commit
f97d8c7bab78 ("rds: ib: use rds_conn_drop() on protocol version mismatch")
made that change, and the preceding patch in this series says the same thing
("the last single-connection caller ... was turned into a drop by commit
f97d8c7bab78").

The same example is now also in the permanent comment above ("e.g. dropped for
a protocol version mismatch and then found again at module unload").  Could
the changelog and the comment use an example that can still happen?

> +	spin_lock_irq(&rds_conn_lock);
> +	if (conn->c_destroy_in_prog) {
> +		spin_unlock_irq(&rds_conn_lock);
> +		return;
> +	}
>  	WRITE_ONCE(conn->c_destroy_in_prog, true);

[Severity: Medium]

The flag is tested and set at the very top of rds_conn_destroy(), ahead of
synchronize_rcu(), the per-path rds_conn_path_quiesce() calls and
rds_cong_remove_conn().  So a caller that finds the flag already set returns
before anything has been quiesced, and there is no completion or state wait on
the early-return path:

	if (conn->c_destroy_in_prog) {
		spin_unlock_irq(&rds_conn_lock);
		return;
	}

That window contains a full synchronize_rcu() plus
cancel_delayed_work_sync(cp_send_w), cancel_delayed_work_sync(cp_recv_w) and
flush_work(cp_down_w) in rds_conn_path_quiesce().

The function's own new block comment states the contract without
qualification:

 * Quiesces the connection synchronously (workers cancelled, transport
 * connections shut down, queued messages dropped) and drops the
 * initial reference.

and so does the new c_refcount comment in rds.h ("rds_conn_destroy()
quiesces the connection synchronously").  Neither holds on the early-return
path, and the void return gives the caller no way to tell.

I could not find a second destroy caller today - all five sites detach the
transport node under the transport lock first, and netns exit and module
unload are excluded by pernet_ops_rwsem - so should the documentation say the
quiesce and the reference drop only happen for the first caller?  If a second
caller ever does appear, would rds_tcp_kill_sock()/rds_loop_kill_conns()
proceed while the transport socket and the workers are still live?

[Severity: Low]

This isn't a bug, but the existing comment on c_destroy_in_prog in rds.h now
describes fewer access rules than the code relies on:

	/* Set once, by rds_conn_destroy(), before it cancels the path
	 * works; read through rds_destroy_pending().
	 ...
	 */

The new "only the first caller proceeds" guarantee depends on the plain read
plus WRITE_ONCE() being an atomic test-and-set under rds_conn_lock.  Should
the comment mention that?  A future writer following only the documented rule
would store the flag without rds_conn_lock, as the code did before this patch,
and a reader following "read through rds_destroy_pending()" would get a
different predicate, since rds_destroy_pending() is also true for netns
teardown and for ->t_unloading.
