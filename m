Please add the Suggested-by tag.

I'm okay with the use of AI to write patches, but it's not clear if
you understand the existing code base enough to use it correctly? If
not, maybe I'll take a weekend to write the patch series to add
devlink support for class devices and you can test it? You can then
write the networking part of the fix.

Just the class devices devlink support alone should be a long patch
series. And should be sent to driver core next. Not net next.

Thanks,
Saravana
