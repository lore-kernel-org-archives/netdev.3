net/smc: bound the send length to the send buffer in smc_tx_sendmsg()

This patch clamps writespace in smc_tx_sendmsg() to sndbuf_desc->len, and
negative values get the same clamp. The copy into the send buffer can then
no longer run past the end of the ring when conn->sndbuf_space has been
over-credited, either after an SMC-R link failover or by SMC-D DMB merge.
It also changes the comment after atomic_sub() so it no longer claims that
the counter stays in range.

> Clamp writespace, which sizes the copy, to sndbuf_desc->len, negative
> values included, so the copy stays in the send buffer.

[Severity: Low]
Should the changelog also say what this patch leaves unfixed?

The notes below the --- line say two things. The over-credit is not undone,
and send() can still overwrite data in the buffer that the peer has not
received yet. Those notes are dropped when the patch is applied.

The patch has Cc: stable and the two Fixes: tags. Without the notes, the
permanent log suggests the failover and DMB merge accounting problem is
fixed. Only its out-of-bounds symptom in smc_tx_sendmsg() is.

Later in the series, "net/smc: bound the link failover cursor advance to the
send buffer" bounds the smc_switch_cursor() catch-up credit. Nothing in the
series changes the late-completion credit in smc_cdc_tx_handler():

net/smc/smc_cdc.c:smc_cdc_tx_handler() {
    ...
		atomic_add(diff, &cdcpend->conn->sndbuf_space);
		/* guarantee 0 <= sndbuf_space <= sndbuf_desc->len */
		smp_mb__after_atomic();
		smc_curs_copy(&conn->tx_curs_fin, &cdcpend->cursor, conn);
    ...
}

The diff_tx credit in smc_cdc_msg_recv_action() is also left alone.

Could the --- note be moved into the commit message, so stable backporters
can see the remaining risk?

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but this clamp limits the copy to the size of
the ring, not to the free space left in it. The free space is len minus the
bytes between tx_curs_fin and tx_curs_prep.

Can stream data still be overwritten in smc_tx_sendmsg() once sndbuf_space
has been over-credited?

The only decrement is the atomic_sub(copylen, &conn->sndbuf_space) further
down. It removes exactly what was copied, so any excess X carries over to
the next loop iteration and to the next sendmsg().

For example, with prep == fin and sndbuf_space == len + X:

  iteration 1: copylen = len, sndbuf_space becomes X
               nothing is posted if the peer RMB is full or the
               socket is corked
  iteration 2: !atomic_read(&conn->sndbuf_space) is false, so no wait
               memcpy_from_msg() writes X bytes at
               tx_cnt_prep == fin.count

The second copy lands on data that has not been sent or confirmed yet.
sendmsg() still reports every byte as sent.

For SMC-R, the old link stays alive during failover:

  smcr_link_down()
    smc_switch_conns()
      smc_switch_cursor()  <- under conn->send_lock
    ...
    smcr_link_clear()      <- old QP destroyed only here

Until smcr_link_clear() runs, successful CQEs from the old link still reach
smc_cdc_tx_handler(). That handler runs under bh_lock_sock only. It copies
cdcpend->cursor into tx_curs_fin without checking that the cursor is newer.

The range [tx_curs_fin, tx_curs_sent) can still be the source of RDMA WRITE
WRs posted on the old link. Does that mean the CPU write races with the HCA
read?

With SMC-D DMB merge the sndbuf is the peer DMB. The same copy would then
overwrite peer data that has not been consumed yet.

A negative sndbuf_space is mapped to len here. smc_tx_wait() also treats
any non-zero value as writable:

net/smc/smc_tx.c:smc_tx_wait() {
    ...
		if (atomic_read(&conn->sndbuf_space) && !conn->urg_tx_pend)
			break; /* at least 1 byte of free & no urgent data */
    ...
}

So a negative counter never blocks the sender either.

Once prep has lapped sent, smc_curs_diff() in smc_tx_rdma_writes() also
gets the wrong to_send:

  to_send = smc_curs_diff(conn->sndbuf_desc->len, &sent, &prep);

Bytes could then be skipped or sent twice.

The --- note says this is known. "net/smc: bound the link failover cursor
advance to the send buffer" only bounds the smc_switch_cursor() catch-up.
Nothing in the series changes the credit in smc_cdc_tx_handler().

Would it make sense to also bound the copy by the real free ring space? The
other option is a tx_curs_fin update that only moves forward and survives
the u16 wrap. Either one would extend this clamp, not replace it.

[Severity: Low]
This comment now says sndbuf_space can be out of range. Three credit sites
in net/smc/smc_cdc.c still carry the old text: smc_cdc_tx_handler(),
smcd_cdc_msg_send() and smc_cdc_msg_recv_action(). For example:

net/smc/smc_cdc.c:smc_cdc_msg_recv_action() {
    ...
			atomic_add(diff_tx, &conn->sndbuf_space);
			/* guarantee 0 <= sndbuf_space <= sndbuf_desc->len */
    ...
}

Should these be updated too? smc_cdc_tx_handler() and
smc_cdc_msg_recv_action() are the two sites that the new comment in
smc_tx_sendmsg() blames for the over-credit.

Earlier in this series, "net/smc: bound the receive length to the RMB"
changed the matching bytes_to_rcv comment in smc_cdc_msg_recv_action() to
"can be out of range, see smc_rx_data_available()".

With both versions in the tree, someone reading only smc_cdc.c could take
the clamp for dead code and remove it.
