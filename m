I find this to be a specious argument.
Of course a kernel without a fix applied is not fixed.

I believe the appropriate question, regarding fixing the Kernel, is if the
cited fixed actually fixes the problem.  That question is not addressed
here.  And indeed it's not a question to be answered here as it's a question
to be answered in the context of reviewing the cited fix.

If this is a problem it is separate to this patch,
and should be addressed separately.

In all, this patch looks good to me.
