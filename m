Hi Bryam,

Below are the test results for this stage 1 patch on z/VM.

Setup: one z/VM guest, two HiperSockets hsuids, two CPUs, af_iucv as a
module, and an AF_IUCV socket-locking reproducer. Both kernels have the same
config - CONFIG_KASAN=y, CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING=y and
CONFIG_DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP=y - so the only variable is the patch.

   scenario     net-next,               patch
   sk_shutdown  fail, 271-299 misses    pass, 0 in 9058 cycles
   shut_rd      fail, fail, pass        pass, 0 in 29 cycles
   recvrecv     fail, 3658-4139 back.   pass, 0 out-of-order in 4194304 
words
   backlog      pass                    pass
   rxclose      fail, 16-17 of 35-38    fail, 14 of 57
   spin         fail, 2020-2190 ms CPU  fail, 2070 ms CPU

No KASAN, lockdep or DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP report on either kernel, in dmesg or
the journal - so nothing reports here either way, and the patch introduces
nothing. Since this patch adds local_bh_disable() around the backlog replay,
moves __iucv_sock_close() into recvmsg() under lock_sock() and holds the 
socket
lock across copy_to_user(), that was the result I was most interested in.

backlog passed on both - it is a guard rather than a reproducer, and 0
frames lost over roughly 1.1 million ownership windows on net-next confirms
it has no discriminating power here, so it says nothing either way.

shut_rd is too flaky to lean on: on net-next it failed with 2 misses in 43
cycles and 3 in 35, then passed with 0 in 45. So its single pass with the
patch is not evidence. Its window is now narrow enough that 30 s under KASAN
is not enough cycles; I will re-run it much longer.

sk_shutdown and recvrecv are the solid ones. recvrecv is what I would point
at: two readers interleaving inside an unlocked iucv_sock_recvmsg() went
backwards 3658, 3896 and 4139 times across the three net-next runs and not
once with your patch.

rxclose fails on both, on the -ENOTCONN that Sashiko flags as Low: 17 of 37,
17 of 38 and 16 of 35 on net-next against 14 of 57 with your patch. Lower
with the patch, but that is one patched run against three, so I would not
read much into the difference. 0 lost tails in every run - though the
lost-tail check only runs on cycles that reached EOF, so the failing cycles
are not data-checked. The test counts any errno other than EINTR and EAGAIN
as a wrong termination, which is why -ENOTCONN shows as a failure.

The asymmetry is that recvmsg()'s shortcut gives EOF on IUCV_DISCONN with
the queues empty, while iucv_sock_recv_skb() gives -ENOTCONN on
sk_state != IUCV_CONNECTED. Either the loop returns EOF for IUCV_DISCONN
with nothing queued, or afiucv_hs_callback_fin() sets RCV_SHUTDOWN as well -
that one is a single line but also changes what callback_rx() drops and what
iucv_sock_poll() reports. I have tried neither. Which behaviour do you want?

spin fails on both, and by the same margin: 2020, 2150 and 2190 ms of CPU
while blocked about 3000 ms on net-next, 2070 ms with your patch.
__iucv_sock_wait() still calls prepare_to_wait() once, outside its loop, so
after the first schedule_timeout() the task is TASK_RUNNING. Outside your
diff, and a different bug from the missed wakeup you fix at the same call
site. One-liner; I will send it separately.

On KASAN specifically, so an empty result is not read as a gap: there will
be no KASAN report from these scenarios even on a KASAN kernel. The
reproducer does scan /dev/kmsg for KASAN and KCSAN reports and fails a
scenario on any hit, but stage 1's defects are missing locks - they surface
as lost data, a lost sk_shutdown bit, a wrong errno or a leaked socket, none
of which touch freed or out-of-bounds memory. KASAN is a clean-run control
here. KCSAN is what can witness the accesses still left unlocked; note that
it generally does not flag volatile accesses, so it may not show sk_state
races either. A KCSAN run is next.

Sashiko's three budget findings look to me like instances of one thing, and
it says so itself on the SO_MSGLIMIT case: stream data is "lost without any
error". A frame that does not fit is dropped with nothing but
sk_drops_inc() and kfree_skb_reason(). Resizing a budget per instance leaves
the next one open.

Sashiko's three budget findings look like one thing: a frame that does 
not fit
is dropped with only sk_drops_inc() and kfree_skb_reason(), so resizing a
budget per instance leaves the next one open. Would you take a patch on top
that makes the loss visible instead - the softirq sets a bit in 
iucv_sock, and
iucv_sock_release_cb() turns it into sk_err = ECONNRESET plus 
IUCV_DISCONN once
the owner lets go? Separately: would it be simpler not to defer
a pure WIN at all? afiucv_hs_callback_win() is only an atomic_sub() and
iucv_sock_wake_msglim().

Thanks,
Hidayath

> a SHT or FIN lost there; a SYN refused with room in the accept queue, or
> dropped instead of refused; an unbounded backlog; a NULL sk_backlog_rcv
> call; the BUG_ON() in __sk_backlog_rcv() and a wrapped sk_backlog.len
> (these two need test-only hooks: a pfmemalloc frame, sk_backlog.len set
> to INT_MAX - 1). On send: a reader kept out by a writer waiting for
> memory; a SHT or FIN lost to a full send buffer; data sent after the
> socket's own SHT, or a writer that waits out SO_SNDTIMEO after it;
> ECONNRESET for a stream the socket shut down itself; send memory past
> sk_sndbuf on every shutdown(); ENOBUFS instead of EAGAIN from connect();
> no SIGIO for an O_ASYNC socket when room comes back after that EAGAIN.
> Besides these, a lockdep splat and a hang. This patch passes all of
> these tests with no KASAN or lockdep report; the only splat is the
> existing WARN_ON(1) on the msglimit path, which one test hits on

> QEMU has no HiperSockets adapter and no z/VM, so I emulated both: the
> adapter under the real qeth driver, tx completion included, and CP's
> IUCV interface for the z/VM transport. The emulation does what the qeth,
> qdio and iucv drivers expect; where they leave a choice, the choice is
> mine. I ran the tests on two vCPUs under TCG with -icount, which runs
> one vCPU at a time. The z/VM tests and a msglimit test ran with QEMU's
> default slice only, the others also with seeded short ones. net-next
> fails 7 HiperSockets tests (each a failure listed above) in each of five
> runs, and one z/VM test: a writer waits out SO_SNDTIMEO after the peer
> quiesces the path. This patch fails no test in those runs, with no KASAN
> or lockdep report, and all 33 kernels are told apart from it: two only
> by what a test logs; one only by the msglimit test, which runs alone;
> and the rest by failing all five runs. Two extra kernels cover the two
> changes that had no kernel on lo, each with a test of its own. One keeps
> a closed socket's frames; with it, a SYN that waited for a listener
> being closed is refused. The other clears and restores SEND_SHUTDOWN
> again; with it, a send() after shutdown(SHUT_WR) can succeed while the
> device goes down, and put data on the wire after the SHT, as in
> net-next.
>
> Two more tests, also under -icount. The freed-device test frees the
> device that a closed socket's frames arrived on, while they wait. It
> sends 600 SYNs to a listener being closed, and a test-only hook delays
> each by 4 ms when __release_sock() runs it, so that unregister_netdev()
> and free_netdev() finish while most still wait. This patch drops those
> that waited, with no KASAN report; with the same hook and no drop, KASAN
> reports a use-after-free in __dev_queue_xmit(). The ingress-device test
> covers the check from your 80230a18c164 ("net/iucv: filter frames in
> afiucv_hs_rcv() by ingress device"), since this patch changes
> afiucv_hs_rcv() around it. On a second emulated LAN, where another of
> the guest's adapters has the user ID of a socket connected on the first
> LAN, a frame sent to that socket's names reaches no socket in net-next
> or with this patch; with the check removed, it reaches that socket.
>
> The same kernels, rebuilt with HZ=100, also ran under MTTCG, with the
> two vCPUs at once (at HZ=1000, TCG falls behind the timer tick, and on
> an idle host every boot livelocked). Each kernel got three runs of the
> default tests (all HiperSockets), three of the z/VM tests and three of
> the msglimit test. In each run of the default tests net-next fails the
> same 7, and in each z/VM run the same z/VM test; this patch fails none,
> with no KASAN or lockdep report. Of the 33 kernels, 30 fail all three
> runs of the default tests and one all three runs of the msglimit test.
> The other two pass every test but are told apart in each run of the
> default tests by what a test logs: frames applied instead of deferred, a
> SYN|FIN flood not dropped.
>
> The two extra kernels' tests ran five times each on both of those
> kernels and on this patch, and the two kernels are told apart in all
> five: the one that clears and restores SEND_SHUTDOWN fails its test, and
> the one that keeps a closed socket's frames passes its test but logs the
> SYNs that waited as refused instead of dropped. The freed-device test
> got five runs too, with the same result in each. With the hook, this
