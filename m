net/iucv: do not count the SHT frame against the receive window

This patch changes iucv_sock_recvmsg() so that zero-length HiperSockets
frames, such as the SHT frame sent by shutdown(SHUT_WR), no longer count
against msg_recv. It also removes the WARN_ON(1) from the over-window
path, which still closes the socket and returns -EFAULT.

Closes: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/179183431327.434549.446348148837850426@kernel.org/

> A zero-length data frame sets RCV_SHUTDOWN, after which
> afiucv_hs_callback_rx() drops every later data frame uncounted; the one
> slot this patch no longer credits for it is lost like the slots of the
> frames dropped after it.

[Severity: Medium]
This is a pre-existing issue, but does a zero-length data frame always
arrive at the receiver as an empty data frame?

iucv_sock_sendmsg() has no zero-length guard, and it counts the send
before the frame goes out:

    atomic_inc(&iucv->msg_sent);
    err = afiucv_hs_send(&txmsg, sk, skb, 0);

With flags == 0, afiucv_hs_send() piggybacks any pending credit:

    if (flags == AF_IUCV_FLAG_WIN || !flags) {
            confirm_recv = atomic_xchg(&iucv->msg_recv, 0);
            phs_hdr->window = confirm_recv;
            if (confirm_recv)
                    phs_hdr->flags = phs_hdr->flags | AF_IUCV_FLAG_WIN;

On the receiving side, afiucv_hs_rcv() then handles it as a pure window
update:

    case (AF_IUCV_FLAG_WIN):
            err = afiucv_hs_callback_win(sk, skb);
            if (skb->len == sizeof(struct af_iucv_trans_hdr)) {
                    consume_skb(skb);
                    break;
            }

The frame never reaches afiucv_hs_callback_rx() or recvmsg(). It does not
set RCV_SHUTDOWN, the receiver never credits it back, and the sender's
msg_sent stays one too high.

If zero-length sends repeat while msg_recv is non-zero, they use up
msglimit_peer. Eventually sendmsg() blocks in iucv_sock_wait() or returns
-EAGAIN.

This patch does not touch that path. The sentence quoted above, though,
does not hold when a credit is piggybacked.

[Severity: High]
Can an empty frame read after the over-window close reach
iucv_send_ctrl() while iucv->hs_dev is NULL?

When a data frame pushes msg_recv over msglimit, iucv_sock_close() runs
and clears hs_dev:

iucv_sock_close()
    ...
    skb_queue_purge(&iucv->send_skb_q);
    skb_queue_purge(&iucv->backlog_skb_q);
    ...
    WRITE_ONCE(iucv->hs_dev, NULL);

It does not purge sk_receive_queue, and it does not reset msg_recv.

The next recvmsg() returns -ECONNRESET through sock_error() in
__skb_try_recv_datagram(), and that call also clears sk_err. The
recvmsg() after it dequeues whatever is still in sk_receive_queue, even
though the socket is IUCV_CLOSED.

If that frame is empty (an SHT, for example), rlen == 0 and the new gate
skips the over-window return. backlog_skb_q is empty because close
purged it, and msg_recv is still above msglimit, so this code runs:

    if (iucv->transport == AF_IUCV_TRANS_HIPER &&
        atomic_read(&iucv->msg_recv) >=
                    iucv->msglimit / 2)
            send_win = true;
    ...
    if (send_win) {
            err = iucv_send_ctrl(sk, AF_IUCV_FLAG_WIN);

iucv_send_ctrl() then computes:

    blen = sizeof(struct af_iucv_trans_hdr) +
           LL_RESERVED_SPACE(iucv->hs_dev);

This reads hard_header_len and needed_headroom through a NULL pointer,
before afiucv_hs_send() gets a chance to check the device.

For example, say the receiver has msglimit 2 and a small SO_RCVBUF, and
the peer sends d1, d2, d3 and then SHTs:

1. Reading d1 and d2 moves d3 and S1 into sk_receive_queue.
2. Reading d3 closes the socket.
3. The next read returns -ECONNRESET.
4. The read after that consumes S1.

Before this patch, every frame read after the close went through the
msg_recv > msglimit branch again and returned -EFAULT. send_win could not
be reached on this path.

On s390 with relocate_lowcore this would oops. On a default boot, blen
would be computed from lowcore bytes and afiucv_hs_send() would fail with
-ENODEV. recvmsg() would then move the IUCV_CLOSED socket back to
IUCV_DISCONN.

Could this return early once the socket is closed, or skip the window
update after a close?

[Severity: Medium]
This is a pre-existing issue, but the classic IUCV transport still has a
WARN that a peer can trigger, of the same kind as the one removed here.

alloc_iucv_recv_skb() does:

    WARN_ONCE(!skb,
              "alloc of recv iucv skb len=%lu failed with errcode=%d\n",
              len, err);

len comes from the peer's message via iucv_msg_length(), called from
iucv_callback_rx() or iucv_process_message_q(). iucv_callback_rx() checks
it only against sk_rcvbuf, and iucv_process_message_q() does not check it
at all.

A message larger than MAX_SKB_FRAGS * PAGE_SIZE plus the linear part
makes alloc_skb_with_frags() fail with -EMSGSIZE. A GFP_ATOMIC | GFP_DMA
allocation failure under memory pressure has the same effect.

With panic_on_warn, a peer can turn this into a panic. Should this
WARN_ONCE() be removed as well?

[Severity: High]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but this read-time check is
the only window enforcement on the receive side. Can a peer that ignores
its window grow iucv->backlog_skb_q without limit?

afiucv_hs_callback_rx() queues frames like this:

    if (skb_queue_empty(&iucv->backlog_skb_q)) {
            if (__sock_queue_rcv_skb(sk, skb))
                    /* handle rcv queue full */
                    skb_queue_tail(&iucv->backlog_skb_q, skb);
    } else
            skb_queue_tail(&iucv_sk(sk)->backlog_skb_q, skb);

Once sk_rcvbuf is full, or once the backlog holds any frames, every later
data, SHT or WIN-with-payload frame goes onto backlog_skb_q. That queue
has no length or memory limit, and these skbs are not charged to
sk_rmem_alloc.

msg_recv is only incremented in iucv_sock_recvmsg(). If the reader is
idle or slow, kernel memory keeps growing until the reader runs or the
system runs out of memory.

[Severity: Medium]
This is a pre-existing issue, but can a conforming peer still reach this
close?

The new comment says "a peer reaches this from the network". However,
the check compares against the current iucv->msglimit, while the peer is
bound by the window advertised in the SYN. afiucv_hs_send() fills that
window in as:

    phs_hdr->window = iucv->msglimit;

iucv_sock_connect() sends the SYN and then waits in IUCV_BOUND. A
blocking connect drops the socket lock inside iucv_sock_wait(), and a
non-blocking connect returns -EAGAIN. In either case
iucv_sock_setsockopt() still accepts SO_MSGLIMIT in that state:

    case IUCV_BOUND:
            if (val < 1 || val > U16_MAX)
                    rc = -EINVAL;
            else
                    iucv->msglimit = val;

So msglimit can be lowered below the window that was already advertised.

While frames wait in backlog_skb_q, recvmsg() sends no WIN, so msg_recv
climbs past the lowered limit. A peer that stayed inside its window then
gets closed: the reader sees -EFAULT and the consumed frame is lost.

The notes below the cut line mention this case and defer it to a rework
that stores the advertised window separately. Could the commit message
and the new comment also say that a conforming peer can still reach this
path?

[Severity: Low]
This is a pre-existing issue, but can the RCV_SHUTDOWN set by the
empty-frame read be lost?

iucv_sock_recvmsg() runs without lock_sock() and does a plain
read-modify-write:

    if (!rlen)
            sk->sk_shutdown = sk->sk_shutdown | RCV_SHUTDOWN;

iucv_send_ctrl() saves and restores the whole mask. It can be called from
a repeated shutdown(SHUT_WR) under lock_sock(), or from a concurrent
recvmsg() sending WIN:

    if (sk->sk_shutdown & SEND_SHUTDOWN) {
            /* controlling flags should be sent anyway */
            shutdown = sk->sk_shutdown;
            sk->sk_shutdown &= RCV_SHUTDOWN;
    }
    ...
    if (shutdown)
            sk->sk_shutdown = shutdown;

If the SHT read sets RCV_SHUTDOWN between the save and the restore, the
restore clears it again. The current read still returns 0, but later
reads may block or return -EAGAIN instead of EOF. afiucv_hs_callback_rx()
would also start accepting data frames again.
