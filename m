net/rds: hold connection references in lookup, sockets and c_passive

This patch makes every escaping struct rds_connection pointer carry a real
reference: rds_conn_lookup() and __rds_conn_create() return a referenced
connection, the rs->rs_conn sendmsg cache owns one and is now serialized
under rs_lock, and parent->c_passive owns one and becomes RCU annotated.
It also closes a syzbot-reported KCSAN write/write race on rs->rs_conn
between concurrent rds_sendmsg() calls on the same socket.

Closes: https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=879c1877016972360186

[Severity: Low]
The trailer block carries Reported-by: and Closes: but no Fixes: tag for
the commit that introduced the unsynchronized rs_conn store
(5c11559046c4 "RDS: send.c").

Since the race is reachable by any unprivileged process with two threads
sending on one PF_RDS socket, should a Fixes: tag be added, together with
the existing note that this is not a standalone stable candidate?

[Severity: Medium]
Is the list of destruction triggers complete here?  rds_ib_cm_connect_complete()
in net/rds/ib_cm.c destroys a connection based on the peer's advertised
protocol version:

	if (conn->c_version < RDS_PROTOCOL_VERSION) {
		if (conn->c_version != RDS_PROTOCOL_COMPAT_VERSION) {
			pr_notice("RDS/IB: Connection <%pI6c,%pI6c> version %u.%u no longer supported\n", ...);
			rds_conn_destroy(conn);
			return;
		}
	}

The version comes from event->param.conn.private_data via
rds_ib_set_protocol(), so a remote peer can have a socket-cached outgoing
connection destroyed during ordinary connection establishment, with no
netns teardown, module unload or device removal involved.  Could the
paragraph mention that path too, since it changes how reachable the fixed
race is?

This access does not take rs->rs_lock, while the new struct field comment
added for rs_conn in net/rds/rds.h states unconditionally that it "is read
and written under rs_lock" (see the rds.h hunk below).

The access itself looks fine, since rds_release() runs from sock_close()
after the last file reference is gone, but the struct-level contract is the
one a later reader will consult.  Would it be worth noting the socket
teardown exception in the rds.h comment, so that someone adding a
lockdep_assert_held(&rs->rs_lock) to an rs_conn accessor does not get a
splat from here?

[Severity: Low]
This is the plain store side of rs_tos, now under rs_lock.

In rds_sendmsg() the same field is still read without the lock and without
READ_ONCE() when it is handed to rds_conn_create_outgoing():

	conn = rds_conn_create_outgoing(sock_net(sock->sk),
					&rs->rs_bound_addr, &daddr,
					rs->rs_transport, rs->rs_tos,
					sock->sk->sk_allocation,
					scope_id);

The other two rs_tos reads in rds_sendmsg() (the cache hit test and the
c_tos re-check) are both under rs_lock, so the lockset for this one access
is empty while a SIOCRDSSETTOS store runs under rs_lock.  Is this
unmarked concurrent access intentional in a commit whose purpose is to
remove that class of KCSAN report?  A READ_ONCE() on the sample would
document it.

The value itself is re-validated under rs_lock before the connection is
installed, so no stale ToS is sent on.

[Severity: Low]
This reads c_destroy_in_prog directly, but net/rds/rds.h documents the
field as "Set once, by rds_conn_destroy(), before it cancels the path
works; read through rds_destroy_pending()".

rds_destroy_pending() also covers the netns and transport-unloading cases:

	static inline bool rds_destroy_pending(struct rds_connection *conn)
	{
		return READ_ONCE(conn->c_destroy_in_prog) ||
		       !check_net(rds_conn_net(conn)) ||
		       (conn->c_trans->t_unloading && conn->c_trans->t_unloading(conn));
	}

and the fresh-conn gate earlier in this same function still uses it:

	if (rds_destroy_pending(conn))
		ret = -ENETDOWN;
	else
		ret = trans->conn_alloc(conn, GFP_ATOMIC);

so __rds_conn_create() now expresses "this conn is going away" with two
different predicates.  Should these new sites use rds_destroy_pending(),
or should the rds.h comment be relaxed to sanction raw reads of the flag
and say why the netns/unloading components are deliberately excluded here?

[Severity: Low]
Does the "neither can be the last" claim hold for the passive put?  The
reference dropped here is the parent's c_passive reference on the passive
twin, and the twin's own initial reference is dropped by the twin's own
rds_conn_destroy(), not by the put below.

Parent A snatches passive = P and clears A->c_passive under rds_conn_lock,
then spends an unbounded time in synchronize_rcu() and
rds_conn_path_quiesce().  Meanwhile P's own destroy runs, e.g. from the
peer protocol-version path in rds_ib_cm_connect_complete():

	rds_conn_destroy(P)
	  parent lookup finds nothing (A is already unhashed)
	  was_passive == false
	  rds_conn_put(P)		/* P's initial reference */

P is then left at refcount 1, and A's rds_conn_put(passive) is the final
put, running rds_conn_destroy_fini() -> rds_conn_path_free()
(destroy_workqueue()) plus kmem_cache_free() and rds_conn_lock inline from
rds_conn_destroy().

That is legal where the put currently sits, since rds_conn_destroy() is in
sleepable context with no locks held.  Would it be more accurate to say
that this put may be the final one and must therefore stay outside
rds_conn_lock and in sleepable context, rather than that it cannot be the
last?  As written, someone relying on the stated invariant to move the
puts under rds_conn_lock would recurse on that lock via
rds_conn_destroy_fini().

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but for the record: after this
put, cm_id->context is a bare pointer that
rds_rdma_cm_event_handler_cmn() dereferences with no reference of its own
(mutex_lock(&conn->c_cm_lock) on the mutex embedded in the connection), so
in principle a concurrent rds_conn_destroy() plus final rds_conn_put()
could free it under an in-flight CM event.

Before this patch rds_conn_create() returned a bare pointer and
cm_id->context equally held no reference, so nothing is regressed here,
and the following patch in the series does close it -
rds_rdma_cm_event_handler_cmn() gains

	if (conn && !rds_conn_get_unless_zero(conn)) {
		...
		return 0;
	}

with a matching rds_conn_put() at out:.  Only noting it so the transient
state in this patch is not mistaken for the final one.

[Severity: Medium]
This is a pre-existing issue and not introduced by this patch, but since
the hit predicate is being rewritten here: it compares c_faddr, ToS and
destroy state, and never compares the requested scope_id with
conn->c_dev_if, even though the miss path below passes scope_id as the
dev_if that becomes part of the connection identity.

For a socket bound to a non-link-local IPv6 address, rs_bound_scope_id is
0, and the earlier scope check accepts any non-zero destination scope:

	if (scope_id != rs->rs_bound_scope_id) {
		if (!scope_id) {
			scope_id = rs->rs_bound_scope_id;
		} else if (rs->rs_bound_scope_id) {
			release_sock(sk);
			ret = -EINVAL;
			...
		}
	}

So a send to fe80::x%ifA followed by a send to fe80::x%ifB appears to hit
the cached ifA connection and deliver the second message to the ifA peer,
because the lookup that would distinguish c_dev_if is bypassed.  Would
adding conn->c_dev_if == scope_id to the hit condition be the right fix
here?

The baseline condition omits c_dev_if in exactly the same way, so this
patch does not change the behaviour.

This is the unlocked rs_tos sample discussed on the rds_ioctl() hunk
above.

Thanks for looking at these.
