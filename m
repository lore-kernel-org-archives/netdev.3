net/rds: hold a connection reference from struct rds_incoming

This patch makes every assignment of rds_incoming->i_conn take a
connection reference. Received incs drop it in rds_inc_put(), and
messages drop it through a new rds_message_free() helper. The goal is to
keep a connection allocated for as long as incs or messages that point
at it remain queued on sockets.

Closes: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20260720184955.3008978-1-nicoyip.dev@gmail.com/

[Severity: Low]
Are netns teardown and core module unload the right triggers here?

rds_create() allocates user RDS sockets with kern == 0:

    sk = sk_alloc(net, AF_RDS, GFP_KERNEL, &rds_proto, kern);

So each socket holds a reference on its netns. rds_recv_incoming() also
already drops incs whose socket lives in a different netns from the
connection:

    if (!net_eq(sock_net(rds_rs_to_sk(rs)), rds_conn_net(conn))) {

Taken together, it doesn't look like rds_loop_exit_net() or
rds_tcp_exit_net() can destroy a connection that an inc on a live
socket's receive queue still points at.

For the first KASAN trace, rds_proto.owner and rds_proto_ops.owner are
both THIS_MODULE in af_rds.c. Every open RDS socket therefore pins
rds.ko, and delete_module() can't reach rds_exit() while task 101 is in
getsockopt() on one. Does that trace need a forced unload
(CONFIG_MODULE_FORCE_UNLOAD)?

The path that does look reachable without a forced unload is a
cross-transport one. rds_find_bound() looks up sockets by address, port
and scope_id only, and doesn't check rs_transport. A socket bound with
one transport (for example TCP chosen via SO_RDS_TRANSPORT on an IPoIB
address) can then have incs queued that arrived on an IB connection.

That socket pins only rds.ko and its own rs_transport module, so
rmmod rds_rdma succeeds:

    rds_ib_exit()
      rds_ib_destroy_nodev_conns()
        rds_conn_destroy()

A later close then reaches the freed connection:

    rds_release()->rds_clear_recv_queue()->rds_inc_put()->rds_ib_inc_free()

This matches the second trace.

Could the commit message describe this cross-transport unload case
instead of netns teardown or unloading rds.ko? The conclusion about
CAP_SYS_MODULE and stable still holds either way.

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but the trailers have no Fixes: tag. The underlying
defect is that rds_incoming->i_conn never held a connection reference,
and that goes back to the original RDS code.

The message explains why this isn't a stable candidate, so leaving out
Fixes: may be deliberate, to keep AUTOSEL from picking it up. If so,
could the commit message say that explicitly?

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but this comment was updated for the new reference
rules while a nearby one in the same file was left as is.
rds_inc_on_sock_queue() still has:

net/rds/recv.c:rds_inc_on_sock_queue() {
    ...
		if (drop) {
			/* XXX make sure this i_conn is reliable */
			rds_recv_rcvbuf_delta(rs, sk, inc->i_conn->c_lcong,
					      -be32_to_cpu(inc->i_hdr.h_len),
					      inc->i_hdr.h_dport);
    ...
}

With this patch, an inc linked on rs_recv_queue holds its own reference
on i_conn. That reference is taken in rds_inc_init(), rds_inc_path_init()
or rds_recv_incoming(), and dropped only in rds_inc_put() after
inc_free(). The kernel-doc for rds_conn_wait_conns_freed() also says
that incs now pin their connection.

Should this XXX comment be removed or reworded, since it now contradicts
that contract? It is still there at the end of the series.
