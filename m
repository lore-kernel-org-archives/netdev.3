Hi Johannes,

For GeoBroadcast the destination area & shape is a per-packet property.
For GeoUnicast and topologically scoped broadcast there is no such area
and/or shape. So the shape calculations need to stay in the kernel to
support GeoBroadcast packets, I think.

To unfold the puzzle a bit, for handling GeoNetworking packets in a
standard conform manner, the following things would have to be done:
* The wifi device has to be switched into ocb mode (included in
  upstream linux kernel and iw)
* The wifi device has to radio in the 5.9 Ghz spektrum, in particular
  between 5.875 and 5.925 GHz[1], therefore ath9k must be patched.
  These patches are not upstream, but rather short.
* wireless-db and CRDA must be patched to support the spektrum
  mentioned above, too.
* The linux kernel must support GeoNetworking, either natively like
  with the proposed patch series or (maybe?) via raw sockets. I am not
  sure, if the support is needed to recieve GeoNetworking packets and
  to record them with a tool like wireshark or if not, though. For
  sending GeoNetworking packets it is necessary.
* There has to be some kind of routing table interface to the kernel
  and userspace tooling to support routing and sending of GeoBroadcast
  and GeoUnicast packets.

> That's a far smaller patch than I expected 🙂

To be accepted upstream, the patch for wireless-db would have to add
these 802.11p list entries to all EU countries, so it would be larger.
Letting them reside in the world domain - which is the current
implementation - may not be acceptable. But the ath9k part is indeed
rather small.

> how do we get anything useful out of a socket family without them?

Valid point. GeoNetworking support in the linux kernel may possibly
increase its adoption in cases where linux is used (already). I may
write to their mailing list and ask, if such an open source 802.11p
implementation exists within the Automotive Grade Linux project.
