This test passes with or without patch 1/3, so it does not test the fix.

It records that a 3-segment flow with one TLP and one late ACK has to
wait for an RTO, and whoever fixes that later will have to rewrite it.

A single TLP probe is enough to get TCPCB_EVER_RETRANS on a segment, so
I am not convinced this case is rare.

Let me come back to tp->tsorted_lost_queue [1]. I was too terse there
("often") and it did not get discussed.

tcp_rack_detect_loss() walks tsorted_sent_queue from oldest to newest,
and whatever it leaves there was sent after what it just marked lost.
So if it does

list_move_tail(&skb->tcp_tsorted_anchor, &tp->tsorted_lost_queue);

instead of list_del_init(), the lost queue stays sorted by send time
across scans, for free. This also holds for skbs that were retransmitted
(TLP probe, lost retransmit), because they sit in tsorted_sent_queue at
their last transmit time. No TCPCB_EVER_RETRANS special case, no
comparator.

- Retransmit: tcp_update_skb_after_send() already moves the skb to the
  tail of tsorted_sent_queue.
- SACK and cumulative ACK: list_del_init()/list_del() are unchanged.
- tcp_fragment(): buff lands next to skb in the lost queue. Today, for
  an skb RACK has unlinked, list_add() builds a 2-node ring that belongs
  to no list.
- Undo in fast recovery: everything in the lost queue was sent before
  everything still in tsorted_sent_queue, so this is a
  list_splice_init() at the head. O(1), no walk, no timestamp compare.

The "often" is the RTO case: tcp_timeout_mark_lost() leaves the skbs it
marks in tsorted_sent_queue, and they can be older than what RACK moves
to the lost queue afterwards. So undo needs a check: splice at the head
if tsorted_sent_queue is empty or the lost tail was sent before the sent
head, otherwise merge the two sorted lists (the forward walk from Neal's
patch, without the EVER_RETRANS test).

Cost is one list_head in tcp_sock and an INIT_LIST_HEAD() in
tcp_init_sock(), tcp_create_openreq_child() and tcp_write_queue_purge().
Reneged skbs are on neither list and would stay as they are today.
Neal's point about per-socket state is fair, but I think 16 bytes is a
reasonable price for not needing the RTO fallback at all.

With that, B is back in tsorted_sent_queue after the undo at .490 in
your scenario. tcp_undo_cwnd_reduction() sets tp->rack.advanced, RACK
looks at B in the same ACK (sent around .413, rack.rtt_us 40ms from C,
reo_wnd around 10ms), marks it lost again and it is retransmitted
immediately. The test then has the same shape as 2/3 (untested):

  .490 < . 1:1(0) ack 1001 win 20000 <TS val 1390 ecr 210,sack 2001:3001>
   +0~+.05 > P. 1001:2001(1000) ack 1 <...>
   +0 %{ assert tcpi_retransmits =3D=3D 0, tcpi_retransmits }%

and it fails on current kernels, which is what we want from a selftest
shipped with a fix.

If Neal and Yuchung still prefer the stateless version I can live with
it, but then the 3/3 changelog should say that the test passes without
1/3 and documents a known limitation.
