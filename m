tls: Bound consecutive no-data records in tls_sw_read_sock()

This patch makes tls_sw_read_sock() stop after TLS_RX_NODATA_LIMIT (16)
consecutive zero-length application_data records. Any record that delivers
bytes resets the count. When the loop stops and a parsed record is still
pending, a work item on tls_strp_wq calls the socket's current
sk_data_ready(), so consumers such as nvme-tcp get woken again.

[Severity: Medium]
What happens when this limit is hit after the parse of the next record
was deferred to strp->work?

After the 16th empty record, tls_rx_rec_done()->tls_strp_check_rcv() can
reach tls_strp_read_copy() if the receive queue layout forces copy mode.
That path calls alloc_page(strp->sk->sk_allocation), and
nvme_tcp_alloc_queue() sets sk_allocation to GFP_ATOMIC. If the
allocation fails:

net/tls/tls_strp.c:tls_strp_check_rcv() {
    ...
	if (tls_strp_read_sock(strp) == -ENOMEM)
		queue_work(tls_strp_wq, &strp->work);
    ...
}

then msg_ready stays false. The new break skips data_ready_work and
returns 0, so nvme_tcp_io_work() sees no progress and exits.

When strp->work parses the record later, tls_rx_msg_maybe_announce()
sends the announcement here:

	ctx->saved_data_ready(strp->sk);

That is the pre-TLS callback, not nvme_tcp_data_ready(), which does not
chain to it. Only nvme_tcp_data_ready() schedules io_work.

Could the received record then sit unread until unrelated traffic or an
I/O timeout runs io_work again?

Before this patch, the loop went back into tls_rx_rec_wait(), which
retries tls_strp_check_rcv() right away. Hitting this stall needed two
allocation failures in a row.

[Severity: Low]
Should this wake condition also look at ctx->rx_list?
tls_sw_sock_is_readable() treats either of these as readable:

	return tls_strp_msg_ready(ctx) ||
		!skb_queue_empty(&ctx->rx_list);

At this commit, tls_sw_recvmsg() with MSG_PEEK can use put_on_rx_list to
leave 16 or more empty data records, followed by a non-empty record, on
rx_list while msg_ready is false. kcm_attach() only checks the family and
protocol, so a read_sock consumer can then be attached to that kTLS
socket.

In that case tls_sw_read_sock() would consume the 16 empty records from
rx_list, break without queueing data_ready_work, and return 0. The
decrypted payload would stay on rx_list.

The later patch in this series, "tls: Consume empty data records in
tls_sw_recvmsg()", appears to keep empty data records off rx_list. With
it, rx_list would be empty whenever this limit fires, so the issue goes
away at the end of the series. It still seems reachable with this commit
alone.

[Severity: High]
Can a peer get around the bound by resetting nodata here?

The commit message says:

    A zero-length application_data record does not deliver a payload, so
    tls_sw_read_sock() never runs the read_actor for one and nothing
    decrements desc->count.

That implies desc->count bounds the loop for non-empty records. For
nvme-tcp it doesn't seem to:

drivers/nvme/host/tcp.c:nvme_tcp_try_recv() {
    ...
	rd_desc.count = 1;
	lock_sock(sk);
	queue->nr_cqe = 0;
	consumed = sock->ops->read_sock(sk, &rd_desc, nvme_tcp_recv_skb);
    ...
}

nvme_tcp_recv_skb() never decrements desc->count.

The loop's input is also not fixed when it starts. tls_rx_rec_wait()
calls sk_flush_backlog() when no record is ready, and
tls_read_flush_backlog() flushes the backlog periodically inside the
loop.

Suppose the peer keeps repeating "15 empty records, then one 1-byte data
record the consumer accepts". Each delivered byte sets nodata back to 0,
so the ++nodata >= TLS_RX_NODATA_LIMIT check never fires.

Wouldn't tls_sw_read_sock() then keep running with the socket lock held
for as long as the peer keeps sending? That is the case the commit
message says this patch closes.

Would this need a cap on the total number of records per call, or no
backlog flushing inside read_sock, rather than a count of consecutive
empty records?
