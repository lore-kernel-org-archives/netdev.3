This version of the driver doesn't support recovery after mana_cdx_dev_reset.

The first HWC request after reset call will wait for default timeout and subsequent commands will fail after 1ms.
A future patch will change the tx timeout recovery to reset the timeout to 0 after dev_reset for both pci and cdx.

This flag represents the capability of the driver to support ndo_tx_timeout for cdx.

The support for reset_prepare/reset_done will be added in future.
