Subject: [PATCH net-next v2 5/5] net/rds: acquire the fastpath locks in rds_conn_shutdown()

From: Håkon Bugge <haakon.bugge@oracle.com>

rds_conn_shutdown() quiesces the transmit and receive-refill paths by
waiting for RDS_IN_XMIT and RDS_RECV_REFILL to be sampled clear, and
then runs the transport shutdown and rds_conn_path_reset().  Sampling
the bits clear is not the same as owning them: the moment after the
wait_event() returns, rds_send_xmit() can re-acquire RDS_IN_XMIT (or
rds_ib_recv_refill() can re-acquire RDS_RECV_REFILL) and run
concurrently with the teardown.

The sender does recheck the connection state after taking the lock,
but that recheck is a classic store-buffering pattern: teardown writes
the state and reads the bit while the sender writes the bit and reads
the state.  acquire_in_xmit() is only an acquire operation, so on
weakly ordered architectures both sides can miss each other's write,
and the transmit path then runs while the transport zeroes its rings
(e.g. rds_ib_ring_init()) and rds_send_path_reset() rewrites the
transmit state under it.

Oracle UEK fixed the same class of crashes - a 14-year tail of
BUG_ON()s in rds_ib_sub_signaled(), unexpected op-codes and NULL
dereferences in rds_ib_send_cqe_handler() during failover testing -
by making the teardown path *acquire* the fastpath bit locks instead
of testing them ("rds: Make sure transmit path and connection
tear-down does not run concurrently").  Ownership of a single word is
decided by RMW atomicity, so no cross-variable ordering is needed.

Do the same here: take both locks before calling the transport
shutdown, hold them across rds_conn_path_reset(), and release them
explicitly with a wake-up afterwards.  The fastpath users of these
bits - rds_send_xmit() and rds_ib_recv_refill() - are trylock style
and back off while teardown owns the locks, so no new lock dependency
is introduced for them.  rds_tcp_reset_callbacks() is different: since
the previous patch it acquires RDS_IN_XMIT as well, and it blocks
doing so, so its wait now spans the teardown instead of at most one
send batch.  That waiter runs from rds_tcp_accept_one() on the
single-threaded krdsd workqueue and holds rds_tcp_accept_lock and
t_conn_path_lock while it waits, so a duelling SYN accepted while its
path is being torn down parks accept processing for the duration of
the teardown - for TCP bounded by the (up to 5 s) drain loop in
rds_tcp_conn_path_shutdown().  The window is narrow: the accept-side
state check has to pass before the teardown moves the path to
RDS_CONN_DISCONNECTING.  The alternative to parking is the accept
path racing the teardown, which is what these patches close; making
the teardown itself non-blocking is a separate item.

One observable side effect: the SENDING flag reported by rds-info has
always mirrored RDS_IN_XMIT, so it now also covers the window where
teardown owns the bit.

The comment in rds_send_xmit() describing the old sample-based
handshake is updated to match.

Previously patch 3/4 of v1 and of "net/rds: Bug fix ports, part 2".
v2: reorder after the rds_tcp_reset_callbacks() patch; describe in
the changelog that the accept-side waiter parks on krdsd holding
rds_tcp_accept_lock/t_conn_path_lock for the (TCP: <= 5 s) duration
of the teardown, and why.
