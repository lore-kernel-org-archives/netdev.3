net/rds: fix incoming message refcount leak and header bounds check in rds_recv.c

The change adds a guard in rds_cmsg_recv() so that the receive-path latency
delta is only computed when both of the two timestamps involved are
non-zero. The commit message describes the change as a refcount and bounds
fix. No Link: tags are present in the commit header.

> net/rds: fix incoming message refcount leak and header bounds check in rds_recv.c
>
> In net/rds/recv.c, ensure incoming RDS message references (rds_inc_put)
> and socket receive queue bounds are properly balanced when handling

[Severity: High]
Does the changelog match the diff?  The subject and body promise a
refcount leak fix (rds_inc_put), a header bounds check, and balanced
socket receive queue accounting on error or truncated frames, but the only
hunk changes the latency subtraction inside the rs_rx_traces block of
rds_cmsg_recv().

No rds_inc_addref()/rds_inc_put() call site is touched, no
rds_recv_rcvbuf_delta()/rs_rcv_bytes accounting is touched, and no header
length validation is added.

The described bug classes also look absent on the named paths.
rds_recvmsg() ends with a single unconditional put that every break from
the receive loop reaches, including the copy error, MSG_TRUNC and
rds_cmsg_recv() -EFAULT cases:

net/rds/recv.c:rds_recvmsg() {
	...
	if (inc)
		rds_inc_put(inc);
	...
}

rds_still_queued() already performs the rcvbuf delta, the list_del_init()
and the queue reference drop together under rs_recv_lock:

net/rds/recv.c:rds_still_queued() {
	...
		if (drop) {
			rds_recv_rcvbuf_delta(rs, sk, inc->i_conn->c_lcong,
					      -be32_to_cpu(inc->i_hdr.h_len),
					      inc->i_hdr.h_dport);
			list_del_init(&inc->i_item);
			to_drop = inc;
		}
	...
}

And j is already bounded at store time in rds_recv_track_latency():

net/rds/af_rds.c:rds_recv_track_latency() {
	if (trace.rx_traces > RDS_MSG_RX_DGRAM_TRACE_MAX)
		return -EFAULT;
	...
		if (trace.rx_trace_pos[i] >= RDS_MSG_RX_DGRAM_TRACE_MAX) {
			rs->rs_rx_traces = 0;
			return -EFAULT;
		}
	...
}

with i_rx_lat_trace[] sized RDS_RX_MAX_TRACES (RDS_MSG_RX_DGRAM_TRACE_MAX
+ 1 == 4), so j <= 2 and j + 1 <= 3 are always in range.

Could the changelog be rewritten to describe the latency change that is
actually made, or could the advertised fixes be implemented?  As written a
stable backporter would pick this up as a memory-safety fix.

> Fixes: bdbe6fbc6a2f ("RDS: recv.c")

[Severity: Low]
Is this the right Fixes: tag?  git blame of the lines being modified at the
baseline attributes the whole rs_rx_traces block, including the
subtraction, to commit 3289025aedc01 ("RDS: add receive message trace used
by application"), not to the original file addition:

3289025aedc01 (Santosh Shilimkar 2016-07-04 640) 	t.rx_trace[i] = inc->i_rx_lat_trace[j + 1] -
3289025aedc01 (Santosh Shilimkar 2016-07-04 641) 			  inc->i_rx_lat_trace[j];

Pointing the tag at bdbe6fbc6a2f would send this to kernels that predate
the latency trace feature.

[Severity: Medium]
Is this a user-visible change to the RDS_CMSG_RXPATH_LATENCY semantics?
When the guard fails, t.rx_trace[i] stays 0 from the earlier memset, but
t.rx_traces and t.rx_trace_pos[i] still advertise the position as measured.

The uAPI has no per-entry validity encoding:

include/uapi/linux/rds.h:
struct rds_cmsg_rx_trace {
	__u8 rx_traces;
	__u8 rx_trace_pos[RDS_MSG_RX_DGRAM_TRACE_MAX];
	__u64 rx_trace[RDS_MSG_RX_DGRAM_TRACE_MAX];
};

so how does userspace tell "not measured" from a genuine 0 ns delta?

The unstamped slots are real.  Only net/rds/ib_recv.c and
net/rds/tcp_recv.c stamp the early positions, for example:

net/rds/tcp_recv.c:rds_tcp_data_recv() {
	...
			tinc->ti_inc.i_rx_lat_trace[RDS_MSG_RX_HDR] =
					local_clock();
	...
}

while the loopback transport calls rds_inc_path_init(), which zeroes the
array, and then rds_recv_incoming() without stamping anything:

net/rds/loop.c:rds_loop_xmit() {
	rds_inc_path_init(&rm->m_inc, &conn->c_path[0], &conn->c_laddr);
	rds_message_addref(rm);

	rds_recv_incoming(conn, &conn->c_laddr, &conn->c_faddr, &rm->m_inc,
			  GFP_KERNEL);
	...
}

Would it be better to stamp the missing trace points in the producers, or
to omit the unavailable entries (shrinking rx_traces and rx_trace_pos) and
document that in the uAPI header?  Either way, this behaviour change is not
mentioned in the changelog.

[Severity: Medium]
Does this guard cover the reversed-timestamp case?  Both values can be
non-zero with inc->i_rx_lat_trace[j + 1] < inc->i_rx_lat_trace[j], and the
u64 subtraction then wraps and reports roughly 1.8e19 ns to userspace.

For j == RDS_MSG_RX_DGRAM_DELIVERED the two samples are taken in different
contexts on possibly different CPUs.  One is taken in transport receive
context:

net/rds/recv.c:rds_recv_incoming() {
	...
	inc->i_rx_lat_trace[RDS_MSG_RX_END] = local_clock();
	...
}

and the other in recvmsg() context, in this same function:

	inc->i_rx_lat_trace[RDS_MSG_RX_CMSG] = local_clock();

local_clock() is sched_clock_cpu() of the current CPU and is only
monotonic per-CPU, so with an unstable sched_clock the later sample can be
smaller.

Would comparing the two values instead, and computing the delta only when
inc->i_rx_lat_trace[j + 1] > inc->i_rx_lat_trace[j], cover this case and
also subsume the zero check being added here?

[Severity: Low]
Can the value tested by the guard differ from the value subtracted?  Each
slot is loaded twice with plain accesses, once for the non-zero test and
once for the subtraction, while this same function stores into
inc->i_rx_lat_trace[RDS_MSG_RX_CMSG] with no lock held.

Two concurrent recvmsg(MSG_PEEK) callers can hold a reference to the same
rds_incoming.  rds_next_incoming() takes a reference without dequeuing:

net/rds/recv.c:rds_next_incoming() {
	...
		if (!list_empty(&rs->rs_recv_queue)) {
			*inc = list_entry(rs->rs_recv_queue.next,
					  struct rds_incoming,
					  i_item);
			rds_inc_addref(*inc);
		}
	...
}

and rds_still_queued() with drop == 0 returns 1 for both callers without
list_del_init(), releasing rs_recv_lock before rds_cmsg_recv() runs.

Since a user-selected j == RDS_MSG_RX_END makes j + 1 == RDS_MSG_RX_CMSG,
the slot being tested is exactly the slot the other thread stores into.  On
32-bit builds can the u64 store be observed torn between the two loads,
giving a value below inc->i_rx_lat_trace[j] and the same unsigned
underflow this check is meant to suppress?

Would reading each timestamp once into a local with READ_ONCE() and
validating and subtracting the locals, or keeping the CMSG timestamp in a
local rather than storing it into the still-queued inc, avoid this?

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but the block being touched
reads rs->rs_rx_traces and rs->rs_rx_trace[] with no lock, no READ_ONCE()
and no barrier, while the writer publishes the count before filling and
validating the entries:

net/rds/af_rds.c:rds_recv_track_latency() {
	rs->rs_rx_traces = trace.rx_traces;
	for (i = 0; i < rs->rs_rx_traces; i++) {
		if (trace.rx_trace_pos[i] >= RDS_MSG_RX_DGRAM_TRACE_MAX) {
			rs->rs_rx_traces = 0;
			return -EFAULT;
		}
		rs->rs_rx_trace[i] = trace.rx_trace_pos[i];
	}
	...
}

SO_RDS_MSG_RXPATH_LATENCY is the only case in rds_setsockopt() that is not
wrapped in lock_sock()/release_sock(), and rds_recvmsg() does not take
lock_sock() either, so the two paths share no lock.

Can a concurrent recvmsg() then see rs_rx_traces == 3 together with stale
rs_rx_trace[] entries, a (count, entries) pair that never existed?  The
loop bound rs->rs_rx_traces is also re-read on each iteration after
t.rx_traces was latched, so the reported count and the number of filled
entries can disagree.

No out-of-bounds index results, since every stored rs_rx_trace[i] was
validated against RDS_MSG_RX_DGRAM_TRACE_MAX before being stored.  This
dates back to commit 3289025aedc01 ("RDS: add receive message trace used by
application").  Publishing the entries before the count, with the count
written last using WRITE_ONCE(), or serializing both paths under
lock_sock(), would address it.
