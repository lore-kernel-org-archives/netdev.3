Will this work on NIPA?

I took a quick pass, nothing pops us for me. The only thing I'm not sure
is the bpftool dependency (whether we need to build it or there is
something on the system). It looks like NIPA failed to apply and run it,
so maybe address 'redirect every packet' and rebase+repost? As long as
it passes HW tests we should be good :-)
