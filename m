Subject: [RFC PATCH 1/4] driver core: add device_schedule_reprobe()

Three in-tree drivers schedule a deferred re-probe of their own device
from a work item whose work function lives in module text: iwlwifi
(iwl_trans_schedule_reprobe(), firmware crash recovery when a lighter
restart is not sufficient), hci_h5 (h5_btrtl_resume(), RTL devices
lose their firmware state over suspend) and btintel_pcie (synchronous
device_reprobe() from its own reset work, with a hand-rolled locking
contract spanning several comments).

Two bug classes affect the hand-rolled implementations:

1. The work function ends with put_device(); kfree();
   module_put(THIS_MODULE); in module text. After the atomic decrement
   a concurrent rmmod can free the module text before the function
   epilogue has finished executing. This is exactly the race
   module_put_and_kthread_exit() exists to close for kthreads; there
   is no work-item equivalent.

2. There is no synchronization between the deferred device_reprobe()
   and device_shutdown() or a driver unbind. The drivers do not check
   any bound state before calling device_reprobe(), so a stale
   re-probe can undo an administrative unbind, and the detach half can
   run against a device whose ->shutdown() callback has already run.
   The core already blocks the attach half during shutdown
   (device_shutdown() calls device_block_probing() before any
   callback, and really_probe() honors defer_all_probes), but nothing
   blocks the detach half. For drivers which clear their drvdata in
   ->shutdown() so that a subsequent ->remove() becomes a no-op this
   escalates to use-after-free of driver state which other subsystem
   structures still reference.

Both classes disappear when the driver core owns the deferred work.
Add device_schedule_reprobe(), which schedules a detach and re-probe
of a device after a caller-specified delay:

- The work function is builtin text, so callers do not need to hold a
  module reference. If the driver module is unloaded before the work
  runs, driver_unregister() has already unbound the device, the bound
  driver no longer matches the driver recorded at scheduling time and
  the work does nothing.

- The recorded driver pointer is only ever compared, never
  dereferenced, so it may legitimately point to freed memory.

- The bound-state check and __device_release_driver() run under a
  single __device_driver_lock() hold, the same lock dance
  device_release_driver_internal() uses. This closes the
  check-vs-detach TOCTOU that drivers cannot close themselves,
  because device_reprobe() takes the device lock internally.

- A new shutdown_done flag in struct device_private, set under the
  device lock once device_shutdown() reaches a device, suppresses the
  detach half during shutdown. It occupies a spare bit in an existing
  byte, mirroring how kill_device() sets the dead flag.

- The attach half is plain device_attach(), which already honors both
  the dead flag and defer_all_probes: a re-probe landing during
  system suspend detaches immediately and the probe is deferred until
  device_restore_probing() at resume time. The detach half
  deliberately does not check defer_all_probes so that a re-probe
  scheduled before suspend is not silently dropped.

One pre-existing window remains: __device_release_driver()
transiently drops the locks while consumer device links are busy, so
for devices with busy consumers a ->shutdown() can still interleave
in the middle of the release. That window exists identically for
every unbind path in the kernel, sysfs unbind included, and is not
made worse by this helper.
