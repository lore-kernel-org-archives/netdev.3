I've also stumbled upon this for our embedded use case: we use CAAM
"blob" keys on NXP socs (specifically i.MX8MP and i.MX8ULP at least),
which pretty much requires af_alg, because the key material is just not
available: it's not a matter of performance (we actually only
encrypt/decrypt a few KB that will be used for LUKS key or similar), the
hardware is required to perform the operation, and the only API
available is through the kernel afaik.

The tool source is available here:
https://github.com/nxp-imx/crypto_af_alg
(which now fails with:
bind(3, {sa_family=AF_ALG, salg_type="skcipher", salg_feat=0, salg_mask=0, salg_name="tk(cbc(aes))"}, 88) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
)


I don't particularily care for the API used as long as we can keep using
the hardware key, but as far as I can see there's no alternative API --
what's the path forward?

Short term would it make sense to re-enable and make it a sysctl knob
like af_alg_restrict[1]?
[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-crypto/20260622234803.6982-1-ebiggers@kernel.org/T/#u

Longer term we don't need many algorithm (the tool only supports
AES-256-CBC), so a much simpler API would do, but some replacement would
be greatly appreciated.. Embedded being embedded we can always kludge
something in, but I'd rather not fall back to that.


(I also second this felt sudden, I only noticed because the sysctl knob
made noise on fedora lists and I wanted to try, and it didn't
cherry-pick cleanly without this patch so that made me try, but I
probably wouldn't have noticed until much later otherwise...)


Thanks,
