A follow-up with measurements, since "the glue needs to skip the soft
reset" deserved more than my word. I ran the v4 pcs-xpcs patches on an
S32G399A-RDB3 with both quirks removed, so the S32G entry went through
the generic xpcs_pre_config() soft reset and the generic EEE path.

Soft reset: it is a hardware requirement, not a preference. The SGMII
soft reset writes BMCR_RESET in MMD 31. On the in-band lane the bit
never self-clears, xpcs_poll_reset() times out after 600 ms, and from
then on every register of that XPCS reads 0x8000, BMSR and
VR_MII_DIG_STS included. The block is stuck in reset until the next
SerDes bring-up.
On the other two lanes the reset bit did clear, but the receive path
was dead afterwards: links reported up, TX counted, zero RX frames,
no ARP across either lane. Restoring only the no-soft-reset flag
brought back the reference numbers (2.35/2.32 Gbit/s at 2.5G, 941/942
at 1G, 0 failures in 36 speed changes, 10/10 down/up on each lane).
The reason is the shared combo PHY: the XPCS reset that works is
VR_MII_DIG_CTRL1.VR_RST inside the vendor sequence, with the power-good
wait and the RX reset around it, and that sequence is ordered against
the PCIe lane and the other XPCS instance, so the SerDes driver has to
own it.

EEE: VR_MII_EEE_MCTRL0/1 read as zero and ignore writes, so the generic
xpcs_config_eee() does no damage on S32G. I still want the no-EEE flag:
the registers are not implemented, and a driver should not read and
write registers it knows are not there, nor let phylink believe the PCS
configured EEE when it did not. The flag is a statement of fact about
the integration, not a workaround.

The AN-complete gate in xpcs_get_state_c37_sgmii() also ran ungated in
that test and the stale-speed race stayed fixed, so I can post it as
generic behaviour rather than behind a flag if nobody objects. It has
only been tested on S32G, though.

That leaves S32G needing three things from pcs-xpcs for 1G: skipping
the soft reset, no EEE register access, and a .pma_config for the PMA.
(2.5G will later need the PMA hook on every pcs_config, because the
lane moves between MPLLA and MPLLB with the line rate. That is why a
PMA entry point stays necessary whatever happens to the quirks.)

On the ID: I would rather not add another synthetic PCS ID either. The
Nord RFC picked the same 0x30, which makes your collision point for me.
What the core already has is the dw_xpcs_info platform data that
pcs-xpcs-plat passes for the PMA generations it cannot read from
hardware. S32G could do the same: leave the PCS ID native, it reads the
real 0x7996ced0, and declare an S32G PMA token in dw_xpcs_info, with
xpcs_identify() matching the desc on the PMA token as well. No faked
register read, and the token names what actually differs on S32G, the
PMA integration. The core change is a .pma field in struct dw_xpcs_desc
and about ten lines. If you prefer glue-set flags, the no-soft-reset and
no-EEE parts fit them directly; the .pma_config still needs the entry.

Tell me which of the two you would rather review and I will shape next
series (most likely not v4 as I have it tested and ready for send
already) accordingly.
