Sorry, i was meaning Linux architecture. Something is feeding in GPS
location information. I assume there is some daemon talking to gpsd on
one side, and the kernel and the other? What other user space pieces
are there?

BTP?

Hold on. IP broadcast, not L2 broadcast. So if you have a mash, this
broadcast is L2 multi hop, but stays within the same IP subnet.

Given the previous definition, this makes no sense. IP broadcast never
leaves the IP subnet. You need to use IP multicast, and an IP
multicast gateway for such packets to go into other subnets. And then
you need PIM or some other multicast routing protocol.

Closest intermediary. So the idea is the maximise the number of L2
hops?  That can make sense, assuming the underlying WiFi network is
using different coding rates. A short hop can use a high coding rate,
making the use of air time shorter. If the furthest intermediary was
used, you need to use a lower coding rate, which takes up more air
time.

And only unicast needs routing? So broadcast is dumb flood everywhere,
and the receiver needs to remove duplicates, and not reflood
duplicates. And broadcast uses the lowest coding rate, so giving the
biggest coverage, but takes up the most air time.

So the sender does not care about the shape, it is the receiver which
does the filtering. And there is no concept of a receiver which is
outside the shape being able to fill dead spots by transmitting back
towards the shape?

So this is a flood search? Is the outward path recorded in each LS
request packet as it hops away from the sender?  So when it reaches
the target, the reply can be hop-by-hop unicast back to the requester?

We generally split policy from mechanical actions. Doing a routing
table lookup is mechanical, and goes in the kernel. The policy of what
to put in the routing table is generally in userspace. If you think
about IP routing, we have a couple of different OSPF versions, BGP,
IS-IS, RIP, EIGRP, etc. Each implement a different policy.

It also seems like there is some scope for experimentation here with
routing. A node at the edge of the shape receiving from a node in the
middle of the shape could consider where its neighbours are within the
same, and set the coding rate for the broadcast based on the unicast
coding rates to pick the highest rate which should work for all
neighbours, so saving air time? And rather than trying to maximise
hops, you could try to find an intermediary somewhere in the middle,
so you balance hops and coding rate/air time?

That sort of experimentation is a lot harder to do in the kernel, it
is more natural to do in userspace.

So it would be good to include a link to your git repo. We generally
want open user spaces tools. And i would expect a generic solution,
e.g. using gpsd, so any of the GPSes supported by gpds can be used.
However, given the simplicity of the API, this is not a GPU after all,
this is less important.

How useful is the stack without unicast?
