All the changes are targeted at fixing an m68k issue, yes.

I can certainly do that. All pre-requisite changes are now in Linus' tree.
My preference would be for subsystem maintainers to pick up their respective
changes (so patches 1, 2 and 3). I expect I will push patch 4 via the m68knommu
git tree, with appropriate sign offs from affected subsystems.
