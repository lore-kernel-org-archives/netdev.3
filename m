can: rcar_canfd: Add support for Renesas RZ/G3S

This adds r9a08g045_hw_info for the RZ/G3S CAN-FD controller: two
channels, 16 AFL pages, a CAN FD clock derived from pclk and a fixed
CAN-FD mode. It also adds the "renesas,r9a08g045-canfd" compatible to the
OF match table.

[Severity: Low]
This is the first hw_info with fixed_canfd set. That makes the early
continue in rcar_canfd_reset_controller() reachable:

	/* Set the controller into appropriate mode */
	if (gpriv->info->fixed_canfd)
		continue;

As a result CLOE/FDOE are never programmed, and the hardware stays in
CAN-FD mode.

rcar_canfd_probe() still reads the mode properties for every compatible
and does not check info->fixed_canfd:

	if (of_property_read_bool(dev->of_node, "renesas,no-can-fd"))
		fdmode = false;			/* Classical CAN only mode */
	...
	if (of_property_read_bool(dev->of_node, "renesas,fd-only"))
		gpriv->fd_only_mode = true; /* FD-Only mode for CAN-FD */

Suppose renesas,no-can-fd were present on an RZ/G3S node. Then
gpriv->fdmode is false, and rcar_canfd_channel_probe() sets the channel
up as classical CAN: no CAN_CTRLMODE_FD, no data bittiming, and RFFDF
ignored on rx. The controller would still be in CAN-FD mode. Would the
software mode and the hardware mode then disagree?

With renesas,fd-only, the only effect would be that the "global
operational state" message prints "fd-only". That doesn't match the
hardware either.

The binding added earlier in this series sets renesas,no-can-fd and
renesas,fd-only to false for renesas,r9a08g045-canfd. A DT that passes
schema validation therefore can't reach this path; only a DT that breaks
the binding can.

Would it still make sense to ignore these properties, or warn about
them, when info->fixed_canfd is set? The RZ/G3L compatible added later
in the series reuses r9a08g045_hw_info and has the same behaviour.

[Severity: High]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but RZ/G3S can now hit a
use-after-free and double free in the probe error path.

rcar_canfd_channel_probe() publishes the channel before registering it,
and does not clear the slot if registration fails:

	gpriv->ch[priv->channel] = priv;
	err = register_candev(ndev);
	if (err) {
		...
		goto fail_candev;
	}
	...
fail_candev:
	netif_napi_del(&priv->napi);
fail:
	free_candev(ndev);

priv lives in netdev_priv(ndev), so after this gpriv->ch[ch] points to
freed memory. rcar_canfd_probe() then unwinds every channel in
channels_mask, including the one that just failed:

fail_channel:
	for_each_set_bit(ch, &gpriv->channels_mask, info->max_channels)
		rcar_canfd_channel_remove(gpriv, ch);

The stale pointer passes the NULL check in rcar_canfd_channel_remove():

	struct rcar_canfd_channel *priv = gpriv->ch[ch];

	if (priv) {
		unregister_candev(priv->ndev);
		netif_napi_del(&priv->napi);
		free_candev(priv->ndev);
	}

Suppose register_candev() fails, for example with -ENOMEM from
register_netdevice() or a NETDEV_REGISTER notifier veto. Doesn't this
path read priv->ndev from freed memory, call unregister_candev() on a
netdev that was never registered, and then call free_candev() on it a
second time?

The assignment comes from commit c5048a7b2c23 ("can: rcar_canfd:
rcar_canfd_channel_probe(): register the CAN device when fully ready").
The error path dates back to commit dd3bd23eb438 ("can: rcar_canfd: Add
Renesas R-Car CAN FD driver"). Nothing later in the series changes it.

Two possible fixes: clear gpriv->ch[priv->channel] on the fail_candev
path, or assign it only after register_candev() succeeds (after checking
that no IRQ handler needs it earlier).

[Severity: High]
This is also a pre-existing issue and not introduced by this patch. Is
there a use-after-free in IRQ context during rcar_canfd_remove() that
RZ/G3S now inherits?

	for_each_set_bit(ch, &gpriv->channels_mask, gpriv->info->max_channels) {
		rcar_canfd_disable_channel_interrupts(gpriv->ch[ch]);
		rcar_canfd_channel_remove(gpriv, ch);
	}

	rcar_canfd_global_deinit(gpriv, true);

rcar_canfd_disable_channel_interrupts() only clears the CCTR error
interrupt enables. It does not touch the RX FIFO RFIE bit.

rcar_canfd_channel_remove() then frees the channel but leaves
gpriv->ch[ch] and gpriv->channels_mask unchanged.

Global interrupts are only disabled afterwards, in
rcar_canfd_global_deinit(). The global IRQ handlers were requested with
devm_request_irq() and dev_id = gpriv, so they stay installed until after
remove() returns.

Consider the case where channel 0 has been freed but channel 1 is still
open and receiving. An RX FIFO interrupt for channel 1 runs
rcar_canfd_global_receive_fifo_interrupt() (g_recc on RZ/G3S and RZ/G2L)
or rcar_canfd_global_interrupt() (Gen3/Gen4). Both walk all of
channels_mask, starting with channel 0:

rcar_canfd_global_receive_fifo_interrupt()
  rcar_canfd_handle_global_receive(gpriv, 0)
    priv = gpriv->ch[0];   /* already freed */
    sts = rcar_canfd_read(priv->base, RCANFD_RFSTS(gpriv, ridx));

Could this dereference the freed priv and perform MMIO through a base
address loaded from freed memory? The global error path also uses
priv->ndev of the freed channel and can call rcar_canfd_global_error()
on it.

Nothing later in the series addresses this. Either of these would close
the window: disable all global and per-channel interrupt sources and
synchronize the IRQs before freeing any channel, or clear gpriv->ch[ch]
and its channels_mask bit before the free.
