That's a very vague statement of "must not communicate with".  Busses
HAVE to talk to the device to determine what the device even is before
it can add it to its internal bus list.  That's just how the hardware
works, you can't say "no talking at all" otherwise that means that you
never even know if a device is there (and for some busses, you'll miss
the device entirely as they can only be found when the "host controller"
tells the kernel that a device showed up, not later by manually
scanning.)

Think about reading PCI device ids, or USB configuration information,
that's a bus-core thing.  Are you really thinking that non of this can
be read from a device under this "policy"?
