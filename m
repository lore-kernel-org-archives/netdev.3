Thanks for your time and the fast response.

/proc has been used during the development of the gn module for passing
gps data from the user space to the kernel. This behaviour has been
changed to ioctl. Procfs has only been kept for debugging reasons. It
can safely be removed and will be in the next patch version.

I'll take a look into netlink and rewrite the new IOCTL code.

Noted. No inline functions (besides proven by benchmarks).

I thought to have changed all pr_info to pr_debug, this one slipped
through.

Noted.

Indeed all BUG calls should have been removed with one of the
subsequent patches together with most of the commented out code. I'll
take another look to ensure all comment out code is removed.

That's good advice. I'll adhere to it.

Fixed in patch 6/6. And partially included in squashing subsequent
patches so they fully adhere to the coding style from the start.

In GeoNetworking routing decisions can be and are in non broadcast
situations based on the distance to the other vehicle/host. To be more
precise routing is based on if the reciever is in the same area as the
sender. If the sender needs to forward a packet to a reciever outside
its own range, it is forward to the intermediary closest to the
reciever.

That's kind of the core idea/feature of GeoNetworking. I don't see the
possibility to move this part into the userspace. But this does not
mean that there is no option at all.

> debugfs? a netlink dump operation?

I'd like to keep this debug function for now. I agree that it should be
removed/changed in the final patch before an actual merge to net-next.
