The reason this doesnt concern the krdsd-parking concern is because the onl=
y
*blocking* acquirer of these bits is rds_tcp_reset_callbacks().  So the wai=
t only
happens on the TCP path, not the IB path.

Both transports' fastpaths are trylock-and-back-off.  So an uncapped IB dra=
in
lengthens that path's quiesce as it always has, but it doesnt park anything=
 else
(the drain behavior predates this series).

I'll add an extra bit to the commit message to clarify though

Sure, I'll rework the comment to clarify the guarantee actually comes from =
both
sides doing an atomic RMW on the same cp_flags.

Sure, we can expand the explaining so more.  I think this is re-hitting som=
e
of the same things explained in v2. The waits point at each other but the h=
older
never needs anything the teardown owns.=C2=A0

To further clarify: the canceled syncs target cp_send_w/cp_recv_w on the
path's ordered cp_wq.  But since they are single threaded, the slot is
occupied by the blocked cp_down_w itself.  So anything still queued behind
it cancels with out flushing.  We wouldn't want to stop and wait for an
explicit flush because the thing at the head of the queue that everyone's
waiting on is itself.

But I'll add a comment in the change log next to those cancels stating the
ordered-cp_wq reliance. So if, for example, another patch were to add a
non-ordered cp_wq or a flush inside the held-bit section, then yes, this wo=
uld
indeed turn this into a hang in that case.

Thanks!
