Hi Bryam,


Two more things since my last note: I ran the KCSAN build on plain net-next
as well, so the two kernels can be compared directly, and I gave every
scenario 120 s instead of 30 s. Same z/VM guest and same config as before.
Only the new results are below, so this is shorter than the last one.

Longer runs, same conclusion as before

     sk_shutdown  net-next 565 misses / 7281 cycles   patch 0 / 12771
     recvrecv     net-next 3917 backwards reads       patch 0 / 4 Mi words
     shut_rd      net-next 32 misses / 212 cycles     patch 0 / 150
     rxclose      net-next 51 of 906                  patch 40 of 1766

shut_rd is the one worth an update, since I said last time its single pass
was not evidence. With more cycles net-next now fails it consistently - 32
misses in 212 cycles - and the patched kernel is still at zero. So I am
happier leaning on it now.

rxclose is still the -ENOTCONN, but with more cycles the two rates separate
a little more clearly: 5.6% of cycles on net-next against 2.3% with your
patch.

The KCSAN picture, now with a baseline

Last time I said "both races predate your patch" was read off the source
rather than measured. The net-next run settles it, and it also shows the
reports changing in kind rather than only in number.

On net-next, 29 reports name af_iucv on both sides of the BUG line:

     19 x iucv_sock_recvmsg / iucv_sock_shutdown
      6 x afiucv_hs_rcv / iucv_send_ctrl
      2 x iucv_send_ctrl / iucv_sock_shutdown
      2 x afiucv_hs_rcv / iucv_sock_shutdown

With your patch applied, none of those four pairs appear at all. What is
left is 2 reports, and they are the two I sent you last time - the
sk_shutdown bypass and iucv->hs_dev. So the recvmsg-without-a-lock races go
away, which is the main thing the patch set out to do.

The hs_dev pair did not come up in the net-next run itself. That run was
dominated by the recvmsg pair, so I would not read anything into its
absence, and the two accesses are the same in both trees.

A blocked reader: the -ENOTCONN question, now with a number

I added a scenario for this, since nothing was covering it directly. A
reader blocks on an empty queue, nothing is ever sent, the peer closes, and
the test measures the wakeup and the return value separately. Half the
cycles have a task holding the socket lock when the FIN arrives, so the
frame goes through the backlog.

The wakeup side looks good: 14151 cycles, mean 0 ms, worst 21 ms with the
socket owned and 29 ms without, against a 200 ms limit, zero late and zero
stuck. So iucv_sock_recv_skb() is doing its job on that count.

The return value is -ENOTCONN in 14151 of 14151 cycles. Never 0. On
net-next it is 13627 of 13627, also never 0, with the wakeup equally
prompt.

So this is the same asymmetry I asked you about last time, but it is not an
edge case - it is every blocked reader, on both kernels. rxclose only sees
it in 2.3% of cycles because its reader goes back into recvmsg and hits the
shortcut at the top; a reader that was already parked when the FIN arrived
gets -ENOTCONN every time.

Nothing new from me on which of the two fixes to take - still your call,
and I am happy to test either. I am only sending the number because it
moves this from a corner case to the ordinary "block until the peer closes"
pattern, so it may deserve a bit more weight than Low.

New: SO_MSGLIMIT in IUCV_BOUND can lose stream data

This one only applies to your patch, since net-next has no budget - the
scenario passes there over 2613 in-window cycles.

The comment above afiucv_hs_backlog_add() describes the assumption:

     a peer that keeps to the window has at most msglimit data frames
     and one SHT waiting

The peer does keep to the window. What changes is the local msglimit, after
the window has already been advertised. iucv_sock_setsockopt() accepts
SO_MSGLIMIT in IUCV_OPEN and IUCV_BOUND, and a HiperSockets socket stays in
IUCV_BOUND from the SYN until the SYN|ACK arrives - iucv_sock_connect()
sends the SYN and then waits, and IUCV_CONNECTED is only set in
afiucv_hs_callback_synack(). The SYN carries

     if (flags == AF_IUCV_FLAG_SYN)
         phs_hdr->window = iucv->msglimit;

and the peer keeps that as msglimit_peer. So a setsockopt() inside that
window leaves the peer with credit for the old msglimit while the budget is
computed as READ_ONCE(iucv->msglimit) + 1 from the new one.

What the test does: raise SO_MSGLIMIT to 64, issue a non-blocking
connect(), lower it to 2, then have the peer send 62 sequenced messages
while a second thread holds the socket lock, so the frames are deferred
instead of taking the bypass. Whether a cycle really landed in the window is
measured rather than assumed, since setsockopt() returns 0 for SO_MSGLIMIT
only in IUCV_OPEN and IUCV_BOUND.

     6297 cycles, 5947 landed in IUCV_BOUND
     1 cycle lost one 256-byte message, which never arrived even after a
       12000 ms grace period
     0 cycles were merely slow

I also enabled the skb:kfree_skb tracepoint filtered to
SKB_DROP_REASON_SOCKET_BACKLOG, and it recorded exactly one event for that
run. One drop, one lost message.

To be fair about the rate: that is about once in 370000 messages, so the
window is narrow. This is the same silent-loss shape as the budget findings
I mentioned last time, just with a path into it from userspace rather than
from the peer.

Two questions, both yours to decide. Is the budget meant to follow the
current msglimit, or the window that was actually advertised? msglimit_peer
already holds the number the peer was granted. And would it make sense to
refuse SO_MSGLIMIT once the SYN has gone out?

One unrelated thing, for information only

While running the device-teardown scenario, KCSAN also reported
afiucv_netdev_event() walking iucv_sk_list without
read_lock(&iucv_sk_list.lock):

     BUG: KCSAN: data-race in afiucv_netdev_event / iucv_sock_alloc
     write (marked) to 0x...3c8 of 8 bytes by task:
      iucv_sock_alloc+0x374 -> hlist_add_head, list.h:1093
                               (inlined by) iucv_sock_link, af_iucv.c:321
     read to 0x...3c8 of 8 bytes by task:
      afiucv_netdev_event+0x5c -> af_iucv.c:2397, sk_for_each()
     value changed: 0x0000000082781068 -> 0x000000008923a868

The list pointer changed value while the walk was in progress. That
function is untouched by your patch and reads the same on net-next, so it
is outside this discussion. Mentioning it only so it does not look
like something your patch left open.
