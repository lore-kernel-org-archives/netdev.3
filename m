net/rds: make rds_destroy_pending() cover single-connection destroy

This adds a per-connection c_destroy_in_prog flag, set by
rds_conn_destroy() before the unhash plus synchronize_rcu() sequence, and
tests it in rds_destroy_pending() so that a single-connection destroy is
covered by the same predicate the work-requeueing sites already consult.
The now-unreferenced RDS_DESTROY_PENDING cp_flags bit and its dead test in
rds_ib_is_unloading() are removed.

A few questions below.

[Severity: Low]
Is the "which all test rds_destroy_pending() under rcu_read_lock()" part
accurate for the current tree?  rds_send_worker() and rds_recv_worker() in
net/rds/threads.c re-arm their own works with no predicate test and no RCU
read-side section:

net/rds/threads.c:rds_send_worker() {
	...
	switch (ret) {
	case -EAGAIN:
		rds_stats_inc(s_send_immediate_retry);
		queue_delayed_work(cp->cp_wq, &cp->cp_send_w, 0);
		break;
	case -ENOMEM:
		rds_stats_inc(s_send_delayed_retry);
		queue_delayed_work(cp->cp_wq, &cp->cp_send_w, 2);
	...
}

rds_recv_worker() does the same for cp_recv_w.

Those two do look safe, but for a different reason than the one documented
here: rds_conn_path_destroy() runs cancel_delayed_work_sync(&cp->cp_send_w)
and cancel_delayed_work_sync(&cp->cp_recv_w), and __cancel_work_sync()
disables the work for the duration of the cancel, so a self-requeue from the
still-running worker is dropped and the worker cannot requeue once the sync
cancel has returned.

The commit message makes the same universal claim:

    since all of those sites guard the queueing with rds_destroy_pending()
    under rcu_read_lock() (the last stragglers were converted by the
    previous patch)

Could both the comment and the commit message be reworded so the two
self-requeue sites in threads.c are not covered by the statement?

[Severity: High]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but the single-connection destroy
path the commit message names as the motivation looks like it deadlocks
before the new flag matters.

rds_ib_cm_connect_complete() calls rds_conn_destroy() synchronously from
inside the RDMA CM event handler, which still holds conn->c_cm_lock (that is
c_path[0].cp_cm_lock, see #define c_cm_lock c_path[0].cp_cm_lock in
net/rds/rds_single_path.h):

rds_rdma_cm_event_handler_cmn()
  mutex_lock(&conn->c_cm_lock);
  rds_ib_cm_connect_complete()
    rds_conn_destroy()
      rds_conn_path_destroy()
        rds_conn_path_drop(cp, true);   /* cp_state = RDS_CONN_ERROR,
                                           queue_work(cp_down_w) */
        flush_work(&cp->cp_down_w);

The queued pass then blocks on the mutex the flushing thread still holds:

rds_shutdown_worker()
  rds_conn_shutdown(cp)
    /* DOWN->DOWN transition fails, state is RDS_CONN_ERROR */
    mutex_lock(&cp->cp_cm_lock);

The handler cannot reach its mutex_unlock() until rds_conn_destroy() returns,
and rds_conn_destroy() cannot return until cp_down_w completes.  Can this
hang both the rdma_cm event worker and the path workqueue worker, with the
connection left in DISCONNECTING/ERROR?

There appears to be a second cycle on the same path: if the shutdown pass
ever got past the mutex, rds_ib_conn_path_shutdown() calls
rdma_destroy_id(ic->i_cm_id) on the very cm_id whose event is being handled,
which waits on id_priv->handler_mutex held by the same stuck thread.

The deciding input is peer supplied: the branch is taken when the peer's
accept private data decodes to a protocol version below 3.1, with
RDS_PROTOCOL_VERSION == RDS_PROTOCOL_COMPAT_VERSION == 0x0301.

[Severity: High]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but rds_destroy_pending() now
dereferences the conn to read c_destroy_in_prog, while at this commit
rds_conn_destroy() still frees the conn synchronously right after the paths
are torn down:

net/rds/connection.c:rds_conn_destroy() {
	...
	kfree(conn->c_path);
	kmem_cache_free(rds_conn_slab, conn);
}

Several sites that evaluate the predicate hold raw, unreferenced conn
pointers: rs->rs_conn in rds_sendmsg(), tc->t_cpath->cp_conn reached from
sk->sk_user_data in the TCP callbacks, and ic->conn on the IB side.  Can
such a reader evaluate READ_ONCE(conn->c_destroy_in_prog) on freed slab
memory and, on a stale false, go on to queue work on a cp_wq that
destroy_workqueue() has already freed?

Later patches in this series do supply the liveness the new guard needs:
"net/rds: split connection destroy into quiesce and kref-governed free"
moves conn_free, destroy_workqueue, kfree(c_path) and kmem_cache_free into
rds_conn_destroy_fini() at the last rds_conn_put(); "net/rds: hold
connection references in lookup, sockets and c_passive" gives rs->rs_conn
its own reference; and "net/rds: pin the connection across RDMA-CM event
handling" pins the conn around the CM handler.  Would it be clearer to order
this patch after those, or to note the dependency in the commit message?
