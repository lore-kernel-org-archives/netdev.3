net/rds: restrict the rdma_cm ids to IB devices

This restricts the three rdma_cm ids RDS creates - the listener, the
per-connection id in rds_ib_conn_path_connect() and the probe id in
rds_ib_laddr_check_cm() - to RDMA_NODE_IB_CA with
rdma_restrict_node_type() before they are bound.  The explicit node_type
test in rds_ib_laddr_check_cm() is dropped as redundant.

>From the changelog:

[Severity: Medium]
Is the "not a fix in its own right, hence no Fixes tag" classification
accurate for the tree this applies to?

The referenced companion patch ("net: rds: fix uninitialized trans
dereference in CM event handler") is not present here.  In
rds_rdma_cm_event_handler_cmn() the transport pointer is still
uninitialized on entry:

net/rds/rdma_transport.c:rds_rdma_cm_event_handler_cmn() {
	struct rds_connection *conn = cm_id->context;
	struct rds_transport *trans;
	...
	if (cm_id->device->node_type == RDMA_NODE_IB_CA)
		trans = &rds_ib_transport;
	...
	case RDMA_CM_EVENT_CONNECT_REQUEST:
		ret = trans->cm_handle_connect(cm_id, event, isv6);
	...
	case RDMA_CM_EVENT_ESTABLISHED:
		if (conn)
			trans->cm_connect_complete(conn, event);
}

So for any event arriving from a device whose node_type is not
RDMA_NODE_IB_CA, trans is dereferenced as stack garbage, and the
CONNECT_REQUEST case is reachable from an inbound connection on the RDS
port.

Before this patch cma_listen_on_dev() installed the RDS listener on every
RDMA device, and cma_acquire_dev_by_src_ip() could pick a software iWARP
device for the same netdev, which is what made that path reachable.  With
the listener restriction added below, cma_listen_on_dev() honours
restricted_node_type and no longer installs the listener on such a device.

That makes this patch the change that removes the remotely reachable route
to that indirect call in this tree.  Should it then carry a Fixes tag and
state the ordering dependency on the companion handler patch, rather than
being described as hardening only?

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but since the patch touches
rds_rdma_listen_init_common() anyway: the debug line further down in the
same function hard-codes the port,

	rdsdebug("cm %p listening on port %u\n", cm_id, RDS_PORT);

while the helper has two callers with different ports.
rds_rdma_listen_init() binds the IPv4 listener with
sin.sin_port = htons(RDS_PORT) and the IPv6 listener with
sin6.sin6_port = htons(RDS_CM_PORT), as the comment above it describes.

For the IPv6 listener the message therefore prints 18634 rather than the
16385 that was bound.  Would it make sense to print the port from the sa
argument that was just bound instead?
