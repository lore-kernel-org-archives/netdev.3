I'll change the message to clarify that the check is not needed for any device.

The removed branch was false on VF and PF2 before this change. Now the branch
is removed.

The change applies to all supported device types. I will update the changelog.

This patch doesn't fix a bug or an issue introduced by commit 1566e7d6206f, so I don't think a Fixes tag is appropriate.

I'll rename the HWC_INIT_DATA_PF_DEST_RQ_ID and HWC_INIT_DATA_PF_DEST_CQ_ID to
HWC_INIT_DATA_DEST_CQ_ID and HWC_INIT_DATA_DEST_CQ_ID. The invariant is established during 
the HWC handshake regardless of whether its PF, PF2, VF or bare-metal.

Hardware sends the values for these fields as appropriate for the function it is sending them to.
A non zero value is not invalid.

This is an existing behavior and this patch doesn't change it. The recovery is already
implemented in the driver.

There is recovery implemented in the driver on probe failure.

I will send v2 with fields renamed.

Yes, I will send v2 with the fields and constants renamed.

Thanks for reporting the issue, since it it pre-existing, we'll review and address it in a separate patch.
