net/rds: pin the connection across RDMA-CM event handling

The RDMA-CM event handler takes a reference on the connection it picks up
from cm_id->context and drops it at the out: label, ignoring the event
entirely if the connection is already on its way out.
rds_ib_cm_handle_connect() also re-checks rds_destroy_pending() under
c_cm_lock and rejects the connect request instead of claiming the
DOWN -> CONNECTING transition.

A couple of questions about the commit message and about a comment that
this patch appears to invalidate.

>     Now that a connection is freed by its last reference, the remaining
>     exposure is a callback that drops the last reference other than the

[Severity: Low]
Is there really a callback below the handler that drops a connection
reference?

For most events the handler calls rds_conn_drop(), which ends in
rds_conn_path_drop() in net/rds/connection.c:

	atomic_set(&cp->cp_state, RDS_CONN_ERROR);
	...
	queue_work(cp->cp_wq, &cp->cp_down_w);

That only flips the state and queues the shutdown work, it releases no
reference.  rds_ib_cm_initiate_connect() and rds_ib_cm_connect_complete()
have no rds_conn_put() or rds_conn_destroy() either.  The only
rds_conn_put() in net/rds/ib_cm.c is the one at the end of
rds_ib_cm_handle_connect(), and that path only runs when cm_id->context
was NULL (BUG_ON(cm_id->context) just above it), so the handler's own conn
is NULL there and neither the new reference nor c_cm_lock is in play.

The pin still looks necessary, but for a different reason: a concurrent
rds_conn_destroy() from transport or device teardown can drop the last
reference while the handler is still inside the switch holding c_cm_lock.
For example rds_ib_destroy_nodev_conns() in net/rds/ib_rdma.c:

	rds_conn_destroy(conn);
	rds_conn_put(conn);

rds_conn_shutdown() only takes cp_cm_lock around the state transition, and
skips it when the path is already DOWN, so that thread is not serialized
against a handler sitting in the switch.  Without the new reference the
handler's mutex_unlock(&conn->c_cm_lock) would run on freed memory.

Would it be clearer to describe that path instead?  As written a reader
could look for the callback that drops the reference, not find one, and
conclude the pin is not needed.

[Severity: Low]
Should the comment at the out: label further down in
rds_ib_cm_handle_connect() be updated by this patch?  It currently reads:

net/rds/ib_cm.c:rds_ib_cm_handle_connect() {
	...
out:
	if (conn) {
		mutex_unlock(&conn->c_cm_lock);
		/* Drop the reference rds_conn_create() handed us.  The
		 * conn stays reachable through cm_id->context without a
		 * reference of its own for now; the CM event handler is
		 * given one of its own by a following patch.
		 */
		rds_conn_put(conn);
	}
	...
}

This patch is the "following patch" that comment points at, so from here
on the statement that the CM event handler holds no reference of its own
is no longer true, and the forward reference has nothing left to look
forward to.  The comment is still unchanged at the tip of the series, so
the two files end up describing contradictory reference rules for CM
event handling.

[Severity: Low]
Same question here as on the changelog: which callback below drops a
connection reference?  rds_conn_drop() only queues cp_down_w, and neither
rds_ib_cm_initiate_connect() nor rds_ib_cm_connect_complete() calls
rds_conn_put().  Would naming the concurrent rds_conn_destroy() path,
such as rds_ib_destroy_nodev_conns(), describe what this pin protects
against?
