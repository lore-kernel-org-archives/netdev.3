The list_lock comes from the previous statement and only the flags_lock part 
was added. The list_lock one comes from the parallel 
batadv_tt_local_commit_changes() -> batadv_tt_local_purge_pending_clients(). 
And it was previously better to have the list lock because 
batadv_tt_local_event and batadv_tt_local_purge_pending_clients only held it 
for a short period of time. But the list_lock was held over the whole time in 
batadv_tt_local_purge_pending_clients() and now still held for 
batadv_tt_local_mark_removed(). A request which actually came from Sashiko.

I consider removing/rewriting this statement at a later point when simplifying 
the locking situation with batadv_tt_local_set_pending() and 
batadv_tt_local_mark_removed(). But it needs a further review of 
batadv_tt_local_commit_changes() to make sure that it doesn't reintroduce the 
previous problems.

But since this needs further checking, it is outside the scope of this patch. 
And maybe it doesn't even work out (see below)

Yes, which is exactly the scope of the patch.

This part is outside the scope of this patch:
https://www.open-mesh.org/issues/481

It would be really invasive because it is not enough to just have a single 
region with list_lock held which then checks for batadv_tt_local_add if 
"common->flags & BATADV_TT_CLIENT_PENDING" is not set before running 
__batadv_tt_local_event() but also needs to hold the list_lock to avoid that 
batadv_tt_local_remove_now() queues a DEL when a new entry was already added. 
Or to avoid that batadv_tt_local_add() added the newly allocated entry which 
was then removed again by something like batadv_tt_local_remove_now() before 
it checks for "!common->flags & BATADV_TT_CLIENT_PENDING" and queues the 
event.

And it could be a good idea to have a fast-path because tt_local_add will 
otherwise choke easily on the shared list lock:

But this doesn't deal yet with the DEL queued in case 
batadv_tt_local_remove_now is called (by parallel context) in the middle of 
the batadv_hash_add and batadv_tt_local_refresh of batadv_tt_local_add().
This would require something like:
