net/rds: unlink transport nodes before a possibly deferred connection free

The transport teardown helpers now unlink each per-connection transport node
under the transport lock right before calling rds_conn_destroy(), so a
conn_free() deferred past the helper cannot list_del() from a stack frame
that no longer exists.  IB gets an explicit i_ib_node_detached flag and the
two BUG_ON()s in rds_ib_add_conn()/rds_ib_remove_conn() are removed, and the
gather loops now take a connection reference for each node they move.

A couple of questions about the IB side below.

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but the comment a few lines above the new check, in
rds_ib_conn_free(), still describes a world this patch has changed:

net/rds/ib_cm.c:rds_ib_conn_free() {
	/*
	 * Conn is either on a dev's list or on the nodev list.
	 * A race with shutdown() or connect() would cause problems
	 * (since rds_ibdev would change) but that should never happen.
	 */
	lock_ptr = ic->rds_ibdev ? &ic->rds_ibdev->spinlock : &ib_nodev_conns_lock;

After this patch there is a third state: the node sits on
rds_ib_destroy_nodev_conns()'s stack-local tmp_list with
i_ib_node_detached set, and is then list_del_init()'ed, so the connection
is on neither a device list nor the nodev list.

The commit message also says "a connect or shutdown worker can still be
running for a connection the sweep has claimed", which is the
shutdown()/connect() race this comment says should never happen.

Could the comment be updated to describe the detached state, and to note
that the lock choice only matters while i_ib_node_detached is false?

[Severity: High]
The new guard covers only the list movement, but the two statements that
follow still run for a connection the sweep has already claimed:

net/rds/ib_rdma.c:rds_ib_add_conn() {
	spin_unlock_irq(&ib_nodev_conns_lock);

	ic->rds_ibdev = rds_ibdev;
	refcount_inc(&rds_ibdev->refcount);
}

Can this leak the rds_ib_device reference?

rds_ib_add_conn() is reached from rds_ib_setup_qp() via the RDMA-CM event
handlers, rds_ib_cm_initiate_connect() on the active side and
rds_ib_cm_handle_connect() on the passive side, which the sweep does not
serialize against.

The only site that clears ic->rds_ibdev and drops that reference is
rds_ib_conn_path_shutdown():

net/rds/ib_cm.c:rds_ib_conn_path_shutdown() {
	...
	if (ic->rds_ibdev)
		rds_ib_remove_conn(ic->rds_ibdev, conn);
	...
}

and rds_ib_remove_conn() ends with ic->rds_ibdev = NULL plus
rds_ib_dev_put().  Once the sweep's rds_conn_destroy() has quiesced the
paths, rds_conn_path_drop(cp, false) is gated by rds_destroy_pending(), so
no further shutdown pass runs for that connection.

rds_ib_conn_free() never calls rds_ib_dev_put(), so does an add_conn() that
lands after the quiesce leave ic->rds_ibdev set forever, with
rds_ibdev->refcount never reaching zero?  That would mean rds_ib_dev_free()
is never queued and the device struct, its PD and its 1M/8K MR pools are
never released, which rds_ib_exit()'s flush_workqueue(rds_wq) cannot
recover.  The QP, CQs and cm_id created by that late rds_ib_setup_qp() also
look like they stay around, since rdma_destroy_id() only happens in
rds_ib_conn_path_shutdown().

There is a second effect in the same window: the connection is bound to the
HCA but deliberately kept off rds_ibdev->conn_list, and device removal only
walks that list:

net/rds/ib.c:rds_ib_dev_shutdown() {
	spin_lock_irqsave(&rds_ibdev->spinlock, flags);
	list_for_each_entry(ic, &rds_ibdev->conn_list, ib_node)
		rds_conn_path_drop(&ic->conn->c_path[0], true);
	spin_unlock_irqrestore(&rds_ibdev->spinlock, flags);
}

Before this patch the node was still moved onto the device conn_list here,
so ib_device removal could at least find it.  Is losing that intentional?

And in the reverse interleaving, rds_ib_conn_path_shutdown() tests
ic->rds_ibdev without a lock and then asserts on it:

net/rds/ib_cm.c:rds_ib_conn_path_shutdown() {
		if (ic->rds_ibdev)
			rds_ib_remove_conn(ic->rds_ibdev, conn);
		...
	}
	BUG_ON(ic->rds_ibdev);

Can a concurrent rds_ib_add_conn() for the claimed connection store
ic->rds_ibdev between that test and the BUG_ON, making it fire?

For what it is worth, at the end of the series the later patch "net/rds: pin
the connection across RDMA-CM event handling" adds an
rds_destroy_pending() check only to rds_ib_cm_handle_connect(), so the
active path rds_ib_cm_initiate_connect() -> rds_ib_setup_qp() ->
rds_ib_add_conn() still looks unguarded, and rds_ib_add_conn() and
rds_ib_conn_free() are otherwise unchanged there.
