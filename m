PKCS#11 is something I (wrongly) picked up from Qualcomm doc here:
https://docs.qualcomm.com/doc/80-70018-11/topic/key-management.html#key-management

But honestly I hadn't read up all that much, and I had been confused as
the previous page talked about their inline crypto engine but this seems
to be more general.
It's been a busy weekend/week/month/year...

> See also the documentation in Documentation/block/inline-encryption.rst

Thanks for this pointer as well; this is much more clear to me, and also
seems to cover keys generated directly on hardware that are not
accessible so it pretty much covers what we're doing manually as well
(once I finally realized that this sits on the SoC side, not the
UFS/eMMC side, as key generation didn't make sense there)

From my 9p maintainer hat I see plenty of patches without 'Cc stable'
get backported every merge window, but this is a potential breakage so
I guess it might not have made it (my patches merged in v7.2-rc1 (same
time as this) were backported last week)

I generally agree with your assessement of vulnerabilities everywhere so
would have expected it to make the cut, time will tell.

Right, I can definitely relate to this, and it's hard to know who
actually uses what especially when vendors add their own sauce on top of
it and don't seem to bother about updating much...

FWIW I'm not affiliated with NXP or any SoC vendor (we're making
embedded boards and providing an OS for it); I'm just bouncing around
between a rock and a hard place trying to ensure my users can keep
updating their kernel without losing access to their data :)

The discussion has been enlightening anyway, and thanks to Richard I've
seen a way forward if we get a backport (or even possibly even move
forward with it ahead of stable), it's appreciated.

Thanks again,
