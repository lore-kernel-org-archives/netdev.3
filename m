Uh, no. You should only use interfaces like new_device with the
devices that really can't be detected in kernel, which isn't the case
here. There is nothing preventing the kernel from detecting the ARP
devices.

So that really can not be the solution that we'll use with these
devices, but regardless of that, relying on user space in general with
the ARP protocol has considerable challenges that I don't see that
could be solved easily:

- You still need to deliver the UDID to the kernel because of things
  like the PEC flag, and the drivers will also need information from
  it.
- With the static (not hotplugged) devices you need to assign the
  correct ACPI node (or what ever fwnode) to the ARP-device.
- When the device is hotplugged, you would need new ABI, like I think
  you already noticed, but this really does not make any sense. We
  simply don't need it, because the kernel can process this
  information on its own very simply.

On top of those there were concerns, like what if an ARP-device is
needed relatively early on during the system bootup, but I don't
actually know how big issues things like that are.

But in any case, I don't think you would ever be able to make the ARP
work from user space except with the simples cases (possibly not
reliable even with those because of things like the PEC flag) which is
not enough.

So why would you want involve the user space at all since it would
just add complexity and limitations without any benefits? The SMBus
ARP is a standard, and _simple_, method of enumerating devices, so why
in earth would you not just let the kernel always take care of it?

Oh, if I just had the power, I would place this requirement on
everyone and everything. Unfortunately I don't have that power :(

I think this would mean that either we take care of the ARP
enumeration in kernel, like honestly it really has to be done
(regardless of this requirement), or we have to continue maintaining
(and adding :-( ) the code in the drivers and board files that create
the i2c-clients for these devices.

Br,
