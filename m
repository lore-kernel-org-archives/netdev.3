Hi Emerson

I find the wall of text in the cover letter, commit messages and code
comments extremely difficult to parse.

With AI, generating code is cheap, reviewing is expensive. I don't think
anyone on the list can or should review a patch series like this.

Please make sure you understand the code and deslop the AI-generated
content before posting.

After reading v1, I think I know what you try to solve, but I'm not
going to accept a patch series like this. A lot of the patches don't
seem to be related to the problem you want to solve.

Thanks,
Wei
