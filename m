T9XX is the PCIe host device driver for MediaTek's
t900 modem. The driver uses the WWAN framework
infrastructure to create the following control ports
and network interfaces for data transactions.
* /dev/wwan0at0 - Interface that supports AT commands.
* /dev/wwan0mbim0 - Interface conforming to the MBIM
  protocol.
* wwan0-X - Primary network interface for IP traffic.

The main blocks in the T9XX driver are:
* HW layer - Abstracts the hardware bus operations for
   the device, and provides generic interfaces for the
   transaction layer to get the device's information and
   control the device's behavior. It includes:

   * PCIe - Implements probe, removal and interrupt
     handling.
   * MHCCIF (Modem Host Cross-Core Interface) - Provides
     interrupt channels for bidirectional event
     notification such as handshake and port enumeration.

* Transaction layer - Implements data transactions for
   the control plane and the data plane. It includes:

   * DPMAIF (Data Plane Modem AP Interface) - Controls
     the hardware that provides uplink and downlink
     queues for the data path. The data exchange takes
     place using circular buffers to share data buffer
     addresses and metadata to describe the packets.
   * CLDMA (Cross Layer DMA) - Manages the hardware
     used by the port layer to send control messages to
     the device using MediaTek's CCCI (Cross-Core
     Communication Interface) protocol.
   * TX Services - Dispatch packets from the port layer
     to the device.
   * RX Services - Dispatch packets to the port layer
     when receiving packets from the device.

* Port layer - Provides control plane and data plane
   interfaces to userspace. It includes:

   * Control Plane - Provides device node interfaces
     for controlling data transactions.
   * Data Plane - Provides network link interfaces
     wwanX (0, 1, 2...) for IP data transactions.

* Device lifecycle management - Contains the logic that
   keeps the device working. It includes:

   * FSM (Finite State Machine) - Drives the T9xx
     device lifecycle (boot handshake, error recovery,
     removal), and notifies each module when the state
     changes.

The compilation of the T9XX driver is enabled by the
CONFIG_MTK_T9XX and CONFIG_MTK_T9XX_PCI config option
which depends on CONFIG_WWAN.

This submission covers the control plane only
(patches 1-6). The data plane will follow in a
separate series once the control plane is accepted.

---
Changes in v7:
- Cover letter: renamed "Core logic" to "Device lifecycle management".
  The FSM is T9xx-specific (same model as the in-tree t7xx driver) and
  stays in the driver rather than the WWAN framework.
- Patch 1 (Add PCIe core):
  - Removed RGU wording from commit message, no RGU code in the series
  - Removed `select NET_DEVLINK` from Kconfig, no devlink consumer
  - Reordered ATR setup: program TRSL_ADDR/TRSL_PARAM before enabling
    ATR in SRC_ADDR_LSB, with a readback, matching t7xx
  - Adopted the t7xx IRQ model: require exactly MTK_IRQ_CNT_MAX MSI-X
    vectors with one handler per vector; removed the merged-IRQ mode
    and scoped dispatch to each vector's own status bits
  - Fixed IRQ callback publish ordering: WRITE_ONCE + smp_wmb on
    register, READ_ONCE + smp_rmb in the interrupt handler
  - Added hw_bits == 0 guard in mtk_pci_send_ext_evt() to reject
    unmapped event channels
  - MHCCIF callbacks stay under spin_lock_bh by design; added a comment
    documenting the must-not-sleep callback contract
  - Added a drain loop in mtk_mhccif_exit() to free any remaining
    callback nodes
  - Moved cancel_work_sync(&priv->mhccif_work) before mtk_pci_pldr()
    in remove, preventing worker MMIO during the power cycle
  - Squashed the MAINTAINERS entry into this patch (was Patch 7); the
    series is now 6 patches
- Patch 2 (Add control plane transaction layer):
  - Commit message and Kconfig help text now name both modules
    (mtk_t9xx and mtk_t9xx_pcie)
  - Reworded mtk_ctrl_exit() kernel-doc: the allocation itself is
    devres-managed and freed on driver detach
- Patch 3 (Add control DMA interface):
  - RX re-map failure now keeps the buffer in its slot instead of
    freeing it and advancing free_idx, preventing a permanent ring
    stall from a stale GPD DMA address
  - mtk_cldma_stop_queue() returns -ETIMEDOUT on poll timeout; alloc
    paths abort on failure, free paths warn and proceed
  - Added READ_ONCE() for the free_idx and tx_started reads in
    mtk_cldma_start_xfer()
  - mtk_cldma_get_tx_start_addr() reads ADDRL+ADDRH as u64, so a >4GB
    DMA address is not mistaken for "queue not started"
  - mtk_cldma_open() decrements usr_cnt on failure. Beyond the emailed
    reply: mtk_pcie_hif_init() re-zeroes usr_cnt and ENABLE/DISABLE no
    longer gate on TX budget, so a channel reopens after devlink reload
  - mtk_cldma_close() completes the TRB with -EPIPE when drv_info is
    already gone, instead of stalling the submitter until timeout
  - mtk_cldma_txbuf_set() returns -ENOMEM instead of -EAGAIN on
    dma_map failure (no infinite retry); dev_err_ratelimited
  - Added the 0x0900 (MTK reference) entry to mtk_ctrl_info_tbl[];
    both PCI IDs are now present in all dispatch tables
  - Documented the single-consumer assumption of
    mtk_ctrl_trb_handler() in a comment
  - Added a submit_lock mutex closing the submit vs. hif_exit race on
    trans->available; hif_cmd_func() now checks available
  - Kept the empty queue table: queue_info entries are populated by
    the next patch "Add control port"
  - Commit message notes TX/RX paths are wired up by later patches
  - hif_exit has no caller at this commit, but ops->init is not called
    either, so nothing is allocated to leak; patch 5 wires up both
  - The trb_handler default case completes the TRB with -EINVAL
    instead of silently leaking the SKB
  - Documented the non-BD skb_headlen() == skb->len invariant
  - trb_open_priv overlay size is safe by construction
  - Removed the unused CLDMA4 support here at the source, instead of
    introducing it and deleting it again in Patch 5
  - Fixed an skb leak in the mtk_cldma_rxq_free() BD path: the parent
    skb was never freed after detaching frag_list
  - Replaced the free_idx/wr_idx boundary check added in v5 with a
    per-queue ring_lock following drivers/net/wwan/t7xx: the check
    raced with submit_tx and could stall TX forever; the lock also
    closes the submit/reclaim race the check was originally added for
  - Removed the write-only queues_cnt and tx_req.data_vm_addr fields
- Patch 5 (Add FSM thread):
  - Commit message: five FSM states (not seven); now describes the
    HS1/HS2/HS3 handshake and CLDMA bring-up/teardown in detail
  - Check ops->init() return in FSM_STATE_ON; NULL guard for srv in
    trb_srv_exit(); check mtk_cldma_dev_init() return in the listener
  - Kept the HS2 feature parser as is: the protocol requires dense
    ascending order and the ft_id check catches violations
  - Reject data_len == 0 before calling the query_rtft handler
  - Drop duplicate HS2 messages when hs_info->rt_data is already set
  - Added a notifier_lock mutex protecting FSM notifier list walks
  - Reordered HS2 handling: parse HS2, send HS3, and only then switch
    state, so FSM_STATE_READY implies HS3 was delivered
  - Unmask the HS channels on handshake error so the modem can retry
  - Moved wake_up_process() under evtq_lock with a fsm_handler NULL
    check; exit sets GATECLOSED and clears fsm_handler under the lock
  - mtk_fsm_hs_info_init() propagates event-registration failures and
    unwinds on error
  - The CLDMA ISR logs, clears and re-unmasks QUEUE_ERROR bits
  - CLDMA dev_exit unregisters the IRQ callback before mask +
    synchronize_irq, preventing ISR re-arm after teardown
  - Reordered FSM_STATE_OFF teardown: stop the TRB threads before
    freeing CLDMA, with the per-hif teardown moved into
    mtk_cldma_exit(); fixes a silently skipped teardown that broke the
    next reset cycle and leaked the CLDMA resources
  - mtk_trans_ctrl_exit() falls back to hif_exit when the
    FSM_STATE_OFF teardown never ran (guarded by trans->available)
  - mtk_pci_dev_start() propagates evt_submit/fsm_start errors
  - Restored TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE for the FSM event kthread: the v2 flip
    to TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE was not requested by review, and an idle
    D-state kthread blocks suspend and trips the hung-task detector
- Patch 6 (Add AT & MBIM WWAN ports):
  - Check and log mtk_port_enable_by_type() failure in the FSM state
    handler
  - A short WWAN write now returns -EIO; consume_skb() on success
  - The wwan_enable failure path calls mtk_port_ch_disable() to undo
    usr_cnt and partial resources
  - Publish the wwan_port pointer only after IS_ERR validation, so the
    RX path never sees an ERR_PTR
  - Pass wwan_port_caps (frag_len = negotiated tx_mtu, CCCI header
    headroom) to wwan_create_port(); a tx_mtu == 0 guard prevents
    userspace write() from spinning forever on frag_len == 0
  - Set PORT_S_WR/PORT_S_ENABLE before wwan_create_port() and clear
    both bits on failure
- Link to v6: https://patch.msgid.link/20260811-t9xx_driver_v1-v6-0-2c969fad57c6@compal.com

Changes in v6:
- Patch 3 (Add control DMA interface):
  - Move extern declarations for mtk_cldma_regs_m9xx and
    cldma_drv_ops_m9xx from Patch 5 to Patch 3 where the
    symbols are first defined, fixing sparse W=1 C=1 warnings
  - Fix RX done recycle path: skip buffer recycle in BD mode
    (nr_bds > 0) to prevent BDP flag mismatch causing HW to
    misinterpret data buffer address as BD chain pointer
    [sashiko]
  - Fix RX done recycle path: on dma_map_single failure,
    free skb and advance free_idx instead of goto out, to
    prevent ring stall [sashiko]
- Patch 4 (Add control port):
  - Replace wake_up_interruptible_all() with wake_up_all()
    for trb_wq and rx_wq in open/close/tx completion
    callbacks and common_close, fixing mismatch with
    wait_event_timeout (TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE) waiters in
    ch_enable/ch_disable that caused spurious timeouts
    [sashiko]
- Link to v5: https://patch.msgid.link/20260723-t9xx_driver_v1-v5-0-b27afb99ccbb@compal.com

Changes in v5:
- Patch 1 (Add PCIe core):
  - Remove LE32_TO_U32(cpu_to_le32()) no-op endianness
    roundtrip, return hw_bits directly
  - Use "%s" format string in pci_request_irq() to prevent
    format string injection
  - Return PCI_ERS_RESULT_DISCONNECT from AER error_detected,
    driver does not support AER recovery
- Patch 2 (Add control plane transaction layer):
  - Rewrite commit message to accurately describe skeleton
    content
- Patch 3 (Add control DMA interface):
  - Replace rmb() with dma_rmb() after HWO check in TX/RX
    done paths for correct DMA descriptor ordering
  - Add ring boundary check in TX done to prevent crossing
    into submit territory
  - Fix RX stall on reload failure: recycle old buffer with
    skb_trim() + dma_map_single() instead of losing descriptor
  - Convert devm_kcalloc to kcalloc for req_pool and
    bd_dsc_pool, matching existing kfree in teardown
  - Set bd_dsc->skb = NULL after dev_kfree_skb_any() in
    reload error path to prevent use-after-free

    segment size in txbuf_set non-BD path
  - Use WRITE_ONCE() for wr_idx update in submit_tx
- Patch 4 (Add control port):
  - Fix direct mtk_port_release() calls to use kref_put()
    in mtk_port_free_or_backup and stale_list_grp_cleanup
  - Add ida_free() before kfree(s_list) in stale list
    cleanup to prevent IDA leak
  - Remove double-free of skb in mtk_port_internal_recv()
    drop_data path, caller owns the skb
  - Add port_cnt bounds check against data_len in
    mtk_port_status_update() to prevent OOB read
  - Replace wait_event_interruptible_timeout with
    wait_event_timeout in ch_enable/ch_disable to prevent
    busy-spin on pending signals
- Patch 5 (Add FSM thread):
  - Validate rtft data_len before passing to query_rtft
    callback to prevent OOB access
  - Zero-initialize HS3 skb data with memset() to prevent
    heap infoleak
  - Set hs_info->rt_data = NULL after dev_kfree_skb() in
    SAP/MD ctrl msg handlers to prevent use-after-free
  - Move wake_up_process() inside spinlock in evt_submit,
    clear fsm_handler under lock in exit to fix race
  - Replace kcalloc + radix_tree_gang_lookup with
    radix_tree_for_each_slot() in mtk_port_disable()
  - Add rt_data cleanup loop in FSM teardown path

Changes in v3:
- Address sashiko AI code review comments and fix sparse warnings
- Patch 1 (Add PCIe core):
  - Move extern declaration of mtk_dev_cfg_0900 from mtk_pci.c to mtk_pci.h to fix sparse warning
  - Remove mtk_pci_bar_exit(): pcim_iounmap_region() was called with bitmask instead of BAR index, and pcim_iomap_regions() is devres-managed so manual unmap is redundant [sashiko]
