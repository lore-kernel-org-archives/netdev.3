Thanks!  Maybe Steffen and the other IPsec folks would have some advice
too.

That already shows that about two-thirds of the improvement you were
getting from pcrypt can be gotten just by using the correct GHASH
implementation for the platform (59.3 => 90.7 download, vs 59.3 => 107;
and 52.0 => 60.8 upload, vs 52.0 => 65.9).

And with that new baseline, for downloads, pcrypt adds just 28% more
throughput (90.7 => 116) rather than 80% as it did before (59.3 => 107).

It seems clear that the usefulness of pcrypt rapidly decreases as the
actual crypto gets faster.

Note: we've been enabling crypto optimizations by default in recent
kernels, so that people can no longer use the generic code by accident.
For example in v7.1 and later, GHASH optimizations are always enabled.

I'm working on further optimizations to the AES-GCM code as well,
specifically implementing AES-GCM directly on all platforms without the
inefficient gcm_base template that is being used here.

So while maybe pcrypt does still help a bit on this platform for now,
the approach does seem quite dated and largely a workaround for
inefficiencies elsewhere in the stack (including systems where the
optimized crypto code is accidentally not enabled).
