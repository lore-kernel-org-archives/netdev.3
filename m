net: skbuff: replace __skb_frag_ref() with symmetric skb_netmem_ref()

This replaces __skb_frag_ref() with skb_netmem_ref(netmem, recycle). As a
result, skb_frag_ref() takes a pp_ref_count reference when the destination
skb has pp_recycle set, mirroring skb_frag_unref(). The patch also stops
clearing pp_recycle in skb_release_data(), propagates pp_recycle in several
copy/split/segment paths, and clears NETIF_F_SG in skb_segment() when
frag_list members have mixed pp_recycle bits.

[Severity: Medium]
Is this list of buggy paths accurate?

skb_shift() is only called from TCP write/retransmit queue paths:
tcp_skb_shift(), tcp_grow_skb() and tcp_collapse_retrans(). pp_recycle is
never set on those skbs, and skb_shift() already asserts:

    DEBUG_NET_WARN_ON_ONCE(tgt->pp_recycle != skb->pp_recycle);

How would the described leak happen across skb_shift()?

Before this patch, the cloned unclone paths (pskb_expand_head(),
pskb_carve_inside_header() and pskb_carve_inside_nonlinear()),
__pskb_copy_fclone(), skb_zerocopy() and skb_segment() all looked
self-consistent. Each took plain page refs, and in each case one of these
held:

  - the destination had pp_recycle=0, since __copy_skb_header() does not
    copy it
  - skb_release_data() had cleared pp_recycle, so the release was a
    put_page()

Isn't removing skb->pp_recycle = 0 then required by the new skb_frag_ref()
semantics, rather than a fix for an existing bug?

The removed comment and behaviour in skb_release_data() came from "skbuff:
Fix a potential race while recycling page_pool packets". Could the commit
message explain why that race no longer applies?

The message also leaves out some behaviour changes:

  - skb_shift() switches from skb_can_coalesce() to
    skb_can_coalesce_netmem(), so adjacent net_iov frags can now coalesce.
    Before, page_to_netmem(NULL) never matched.
  - Every skb_frag_ref() caller this patch does not touch now takes pp refs
    when pp_recycle is set. That includes iptfs_consume_frags(),
    tcp_clone_payload(), __skb_zcopy_downgrade_managed(),
    pskb_expand_head() and the pskb_carve_*() helpers.

Should these be called out?

[Severity: Medium]
This fixes page_pool refcount corruption that can be reached today, but the
trailers have no Fixes: tag or stable Cc. Should they be added?

For IP-TFS, the actual fix appears to be a behaviour change at a call site
in iptfs_consume_frags() that this patch does not touch:

    iptfs_skb_head_to_frag(from, &toi->frags[toi->nr_frags]);
    skb_frag_ref(to, toi->nr_frags++);

Before this patch, that took a plain get_page() on from's page_pool head
page. Then consume_skb(from) dropped a pp ref, and to (pp_recycle=1) later
dropped another pp ref through napi_pp_put_page(). Could the commit message
name this call site as the IP-TFS fix?

For skb_split(), batadv_frag_create() calls:

    skb_split(skb, skb_fragment, skb->len - fragment_size);

skb_fragment comes from dev_alloc_skb(), so it has pp_recycle=0.
batadv_frag_send_packet() only linearizes frag_list, not frags[].

Before this patch, page_pool-backed frags moved into skb_fragment were
later released with put_page() while page_pool still considered them in
flight. The new skb1->pp_recycle = skb->pp_recycle in skb_split() fixes
this, but the caller is not mentioned.

The fix is mixed in with an API rename and a semantic change to every
skb_frag_ref() caller. Would splitting the fixes out make them easier to
backport?

Also, how does this patch relate to the separately linked IP-TFS fix [1],
which touches the same code?

[Severity: High]
Can clearing NETIF_F_SG here lead skb_segment() into BUG_ON(i >= nfrags)?

Each iteration of the !sg copy path ends with continue. It never advances
pos, i, frag, nfrags or list_skb:

    if (!sg) {
        ...
            if (skb_copy_bits(head_skb, offset, skb_put(nskb, len), len))
                goto err;
        }
        continue;
    }

Once hsize <= 0 and i >= nfrags, a later segment can take the clone branch
with a stale list_skb and pos. This happens when its len equals
skb_headlen() of that stale list_skb:

    if (hsize <= 0 && i >= nfrags && skb_headlen(list_skb) &&
        (skb_headlen(list_skb) == len || sg)) {
        ...
        while (pos < offset + len) {
            BUG_ON(i >= nfrags);

Take this example with mss 1000:

  - head_skb has 1000 bytes of linear payload and no frags
  - frag_list member A has 100 linear bytes, one 900 byte frag, and
    pp_recycle=1
  - member B has 100 linear bytes and pp_recycle=0

With SG cleared, the iterations go like this:

  - iteration 1 copies the head
  - iteration 2 has hsize 0 and headlen(A) 100 != len 1000, so it copies A
    without advancing the cursor
  - iteration 3 has len 100 == headlen(A), so it clones the stale A
  - pos goes from doffset+1000 to doffset+1100, and then to doffset+2000
    after the 900 byte frag
  - pos is still below offset + len (doffset+2100), so BUG_ON(1 >= 1)
    fires

With other geometries, could nskb instead be cloned from the wrong
frag_list member and carry the wrong payload?

Mixed pp_recycle frag_lists look reachable:

  - skb_gro_receive() rejects mismatched pp_recycle, but
    skb_gro_receive_list() does not check it.
  - Drivers like bnxt mix copybreak napi_alloc_skb() skbs (pp_recycle=0)
    with page_pool skbs (pp_recycle=1).
  - tcp4_gso_segment() falls back from __tcp4_gso_segment_list() to
    skb_segment() when SKB_GSO_DODGY is set (for example by a tc BPF
    program) or when skb_pagelen() no longer matches gso_size.

The !sg cursor issue predates this patch. But before this change, these
skbs took the SG path, where the cursor stays in sync.
