net/sched: fq, fq_codel, fq_pie: skip empty rounds in the deficit-refill dequeue loop

This patch adds a skip-ahead to the deficit-refill dequeue loops of fq,
fq_codel and fq_pie. After a full round in which no flow could dequeue, it
gives every flow the quanta for the remaining rounds in one pass. In the
same pass it removes the empty flows the old one-quantum loop would have
removed.

This isn't a bug in the code, but should this have a Fixes: tag and a
Cc: stable? The dequeue spin has been in fq, fq_codel and fq_pie since they
were merged. Without those tags, stable maintainers have nothing to act on.

The companion commit "net/sched: drr, ets, sfq: skip empty rounds in the
deficit-refill dequeue loop" says the trigger only needs CAP_NET_ADMIN
("unshare -Urn is enough"). Could this commit message say the same?

Using Link: rather than Closes: after Reported-by: is fine as it is, since
checkpatch accepts either.

Can one trap flow per dequeue bring back the full cost here?

In fq_dequeue(), scanned is set to true as soon as the scan starts. That
includes the case where the scan stops early because a non-empty flow
already has credit > 0 (skip = false; break;). After that, the
!scanned && f == first check cannot pass again in this call. fq clears
scanned only when the band changes.

If the flow that became eligible is then throttled, the code above sets
first to NULL. The remaining flows then go back to one quantum per
iteration. With the 1 MiB stab inflation and quantum 256, that is about
N * 4096 iterations again.

__fq_codel_dequeue() has the same latch and never clears scanned. There the
trap is an eligible flow whose packets codel_dequeue() all drops, which hits
the !skb path:

	list_del_init(&flow->flowchain);
	if (flow == first)
		first = scanned ? NULL : ...;

The commit message mentions this ("A setup built to make that happen every
time is as slow as before"). In fq, though, one paced or EDT flow with a
small deficit (SO_TXTIME, SO_MAX_PACING_RATE, maxrate or
low_rate_threshold) per dequeue looks like enough. The message also doesn't
cover the early-stop case.

Would it make sense to allow the scan to run again after the round's first
flow leaves, instead of once per dequeue?

Also, fq_pie_qdisc_dequeue() never drops at dequeue, so an eligible
non-empty flow always dequeues. Is the "all its packets are dropped by the
AQM (fq_codel, fq_pie)" wording accurate for fq_pie?

[Severity: Medium]
Do flows removed here keep stale CoDel state?

The old one-quantum loop always reached such an empty flow with
deficit > 0 before any non-empty flow became eligible (k < rounds). It then
called codel_dequeue() on it. With no skb, that resets the CoDel vars
before the !skb path calls list_del_init():

include/net/codel_impl.h:codel_dequeue() {
	...
	if (!skb) {
		vars->first_above_time = 0;
		WRITE_ONCE(vars->dropping, false);
		return skb;
	}
	...
}

The skip pass unlinks the flow without that reset. When the flow comes
back, fq_codel_enqueue() only restores list membership and deficit:

	if (list_empty(&flow->flowchain)) {
		list_add_tail(&flow->flowchain, &q->new_flows);
		q->new_flow_count++;
		WRITE_ONCE(flow->deficit, q->quantum);
	}

Suppose the flow's last packet had sojourn >= target while the backlog was
above mtu. Then first_above_time stays non-zero and in the past. On the
first packet after the flow comes back, codel_should_drop() takes the
codel_time_after(now, vars->first_above_time) branch and returns
ok_to_drop.

If dropping is still true and drop_next has passed, codel_dequeue() goes
straight into its drop loop with the old count and rec_inv_sqrt. The old
code would have set first_above_time = now + interval and not dropped.

The commit message says the new pass matches the old loop, but the CoDel
state differs here. fq and fq_pie don't have this side effect when they
remove a flow, so only fq_codel seems to be affected.

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, not one introduced by this patch, but should
sch_cake get the same treatment? cake_dequeue() still has the DRR++ refill
loop this series replaces in fq_codel:

net/sched/sch_cake.c:cake_dequeue() {
	...
	if (flow->deficit <= 0) {
		...
		WRITE_ONCE(flow->deficit,
			   flow->deficit + cake_get_flow_quantum(b, flow, q->config->flow_mode));
		list_move_tail(&flow->flowchain, &b->old_flows);

		goto retry;
	}
	...
}

cake_overhead() starts from qdisc_pkt_len(), so the same 1 MiB stab
overhead applies to cake.

cake_set_rate() clamps b->flow_quantum to 300..1514. cake_get_flow_quantum()
then scales it by quantum_div[host_load], and host_load can reach
CAKE_QUEUES (1024). So the average refill can drop below one byte.

With up to 1024 bulk flows in a tin, that is roughly 1024 * (2^20 / 300),
about 3.6M iterations per dequeue without host scaling, and far more with
it. All of this runs under the root qdisc lock with BH disabled.

hhf_dequeue() in sch_hhf.c has the same loop. It only has two WDRR buckets
and quantum >= 256, though, so its cost doesn't grow with the number of
flows.
