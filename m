Agreed, I had sent out a v4 last night just before this response. The code =
change
is the same, but I did add the Fixes tag for the listeners the review talke=
d about.
As well a comment stating the patches are independent.

The companion patch is Aohan's, and his v2 thread has been quiet since late
August, so I'll carry it forward as a v3 to net with the review comments
on v2 addressed.

Yes, v4 has that as a separate second patch to address this part

Thank you!  I'll carry your rvb on patch 1 of v4 unless you'd
rather look at it again.
