When the MAC driver manages PHY PM, phylib never sets irq_suspended, and
a PHY interrupt during the sleep transition runs the PHY driver's
handler while the MDIO bus may be powered down. On Helios64 (dwmac-rk)
this hangs the board on suspend as well as on resume.

mac_managed_pm hands phy_suspend(), phy_resume() and the state machine
to the MAC driver, since commit fba863b81604 ("net: phy: make PHY PM
ops a no-op if MAC driver manages PHY PM"); the PHY interrupt stays
with phylib, and so does postponing it.

Patches 1-3 fix the postponing that phylib applies to other PHYs, so
that patch 4 can extend it to MAC-managed ones. Patch 1 moves the two
flags out of a bitfield they share with the link state written under
phydev->lock. Patch 2 keeps the line of a postponed interrupt balanced
when an edge reruns the IRQ thread or the PHY frees a line it was alone
on during the transition. Patch 3 undoes the postponing when
phy_suspend() fails. Patch 4 sets irq_suspended for MAC-managed PHYs
too; their postponed interrupts report no wakeup.

Patch 4 fixes a hang seen on Helios64 (dwmac-rk, RTL8211F): in s2idle
without WoL the board hung or reset 10 of 10 times without the series.
The PHY IRQ thread stalls its CPU on an MDIO read while the GMAC clocks
are off, so that CPU never answers the NMI:

  watchdog: CPU0: Watchdog detected hard LOCKUP on cpu 1
  After 10 seconds, these CPUS still haven't responded to the NMI: 1

Patches 1-3 fix defects found by code inspection and Sashiko review;
they were not triggered.

With MAC-managed PM, a postponed interrupt cannot tell Wake-on-LAN from
a link change that the MAC causes, so it reports no wakeup: a magic
packet during the transition does not abort it. A PHY that leaves its
link interrupt unmasked under Wake-on-LAN still disables its line when
stmmac lowers the link speed, and may not wake the system from that
sleep.

Not covered: MDIO accesses from closing or opening the interface during
the transition, and a MAC resume that fails to power the bus up. On a
shared line, a postponed PHY interrupt disables the line for its other
users until the PHY resumes, also when the PHY frees its interrupt in
between; patch 4 extends that to MAC-managed PHYs. When
mdio_bus_phy_resume() fails, the interrupts stay postponed.
phy_free_interrupt() checks irq_has_action() after free_irq(), so a
driver that requests the line in between gets an unbalanced enable_irq()
at resume. A nested threaded PHY interrupt is not replayed
(irq_wake_thread() has no thread to wake), and
mdio_bus_phy_may_suspend() does not ask phy_may_wakeup() about an
attached PHY.

Tested on Helios64 (dwmac-rk, RTL8211F); Haoning Cheng tested v5 on
i.MX6 (fec).

Changes in v6:
- patch 2: phy_free_interrupt() enables no line; it clears irq_rerun
  when the PHY was alone on the line, and mdio_bus_phy_resume()
  enables a shared line. Enabling it in phy_free_interrupt() could
  unmask a source that phy_disable_interrupts() failed to clear, or
  unbalance a wakeup line in the noirq phase (Sashiko on v5)
- patch 3: the resume error path is left as in net; clearing
  irq_suspended there let the handler reach a PHY that failed to
  resume (Sashiko on v5)
- patch 4: with mac_managed_pm, a postponed interrupt reports no
  wakeup, and other PHYs report what they report in net; irq_wake,
  wol_phy and the barriers are gone. A wakeup on Wake-on-LAN in the
  PHY let link interrupts that the MAC causes abort suspend on PHYs
  that leave them unmasked (Sashiko on v5)
- patch 1: the comment names the writers of the two flags (Sashiko on
  v5)
- patch 2: irq_pm_lock sits next to lock in struct phy_device
- comments say again that postponing lasts until the PHY has resumed
- the cover letter says what was reproduced (Jakub)
- Haoning Cheng's Tested-by on v5 kept on patch 1 only
- rebased on net
- tests rerun on v6
- Link to v5: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20261111-b4-phylib-mac-pm-irq-v3-v5-0-bbfdb5afb7d3@iav.lv

Changes in v5:
- v4 patch 2 alone could leave irq_rerun set across
  phy_free_interrupt() and a new request, after which a postponed
  level interrupt fired without end; it is merged with v4 patch 3 into
  patch 2. phy_free_interrupt() re-enables the line after free_irq(),
  not before, and only while other users of a shared line remain, so
  the handler cannot keep running on a source it cannot quiet;
  irq_rerun stays a bool (Sashiko on v4)
- patch 3: when the PHY fails to resume, the line a postponed
  interrupt disabled stays off, as before this series, instead of
  rerunning a handler that may not reach the PHY (Sashiko on v4)
- patch 4: with mac_managed_pm, only Wake-on-LAN in the PHY makes a
  postponed interrupt a wakeup; the ethtool flag may describe
  Wake-on-LAN in the MAC, as with fec (Sashiko on v4); for a PHY that
  phy_suspend() already suspended, the PHY part of its Wake-on-LAN
  state is kept in the new wol_phy
- patch 4: Fixes: now points at 1758bde2e4aa, which added the
  postponing after the early return for MAC-managed PHY PM
- comments say that postponing lasts until the transition ends
- Haoning Cheng's Tested-by on v4 kept on patch 1 only: patches 2-4
  changed
- rebased on net
- tests rerun on v5
- Link to v4: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20261031-b4-phylib-mac-pm-irq-v3-v4-0-5ba23b3ff9a4@iav.lv

Changes in v4:
- new patches 2-4, one pre-existing defect each
- patch 2: an edge that reruns the IRQ thread no longer disables the
  line twice
- patch 3: phy_free_interrupt() during the transition keeps the line
  balanced (Sashiko on v3)
- patch 4: a failing PHY PM callback no longer leaves the interrupt
  postponed (Sashiko on v2 and v3)
- patch 5: the wakeup event is decided in mdio_bus_phy_suspend(), where
  phy_may_wakeup() can still read the PHY (Sashiko on v3); Fixes: now
  points at the stmmac commit that took its PHYs out of postponing
- v3 asked phylib or phylink_suspend(): phylib, as macb sets
  mac_managed_pm but suspends with phylink_stop()
- tests rerun on v4
- Link to v3: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20261029-b4-phylib-mac-pm-irq-v3-v3-0-5907045f3210@iav.lv

Changes in v3:
- with mac_managed_pm, a postponed interrupt signals a wakeup event only
  with Wake-on-LAN; with MAC power/wakeup enabled and no WoL, v2 aborted
  s2idle on Helios64 3 of 3 times, v3 0 of 3 (reported by Sashiko)
- phy_free_interrupt(): stop postponing and re-enable the line before
  free_irq(), not after it (reported by Sashiko)
- mdio_bus_phy_suspend() comment narrowed to the MDIO bus (reported by
  Sashiko)
- patch 1: Andrew suggested taking phydev->lock in phy_interrupt();
  the commit message says why that does not close the race
- tests rerun on v3
- Link to v2: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20261026045343.837889-1-iav@iav.lv
