The point is you want a very simple driver which it is possible to
review.

This is one of those 0, 1, many cases. Just having one portal entry
means you don't need any allocation algorithm, you don't need recovery
when it overflows, you don't need to be able to replace it, reference
counting, etc. It gives you a starting point to expand later in a
followup patch set which adds all these things.

The network stack is happy to handle promiscuous mode, it does it all
the time when you use ethtool and put the interface into promisc mode.
It is clearly not as efficient as having the hardware doing filtering,
but it works.

Think about this from the other direction. How does promisc mode work?

That is one of the MAC addresses it needs to receive. But when you
come to implement .ndo_set_rx_mode you are given a list of unicast and
multicast MAC addresses you are supposed to receive. And if the
hardware cannot do a perfect match, you do a less perfect match and
let the stack deal with the rest.

How does it define bare minimum.

If you have thrown out ethtool, you cannot change or report the link
speed. If you cannot change the link speed, and you have followed IEEE
802.3, your PCS will probably just come up when powered on, since the
standard gives the registers sensible defaults. So all your PCS driver
needs to do is poll for link. A typical PCS driver is around 2K lines
of code, and that actually does more.
