Subject: [PATCH net-next v11 06/12] net/rds: unlink transport nodes before a possibly deferred connection free

The transport teardown helpers - rds_tcp_destroy_conns(),
rds_tcp_kill_sock(), rds_ib_destroy_nodev_conns(), rds_loop_exit() and
rds_loop_kill_conns() - gather the per-connection transport nodes onto
a list head on their own stack and call rds_conn_destroy() for each.
The node is unlinked much later, by the transport's conn_free():
rds_tcp_conn_free() skips a node that rds_tcp_kill_sock() marked
detached, while rds_loop_conn_free() and rds_ib_conn_free() list_del()
it unconditionally.

That is fine for as long as rds_conn_destroy() frees the connection
before it returns, which is still the case at this point in the
series: the initial reference is the only one.  The following patches
hand out references that outlive the teardown loop - a socket's
cached rs_conn, an inc parked on a receive queue - and with those, a
conn_free() deferred until after the helper has returned would
list_del() the node from a stack frame that no longer exists.  Make
the helpers ready for that first.

Unlink each node right before its rds_conn_destroy() - under the
transport lock for TCP and loopback, and off the claimed stack list
for IB - so that nothing is left on the stack list for a later free
to touch.  TCP marks the node detached, as
rds_tcp_kill_sock() already does for the secondary paths of a
multipath connection; loopback uses list_del_init() and has its
conn_free() skip a node that is already empty.

IB needs an explicit flag, i_ib_node_detached, because its node has
other movers: a connect worker moves it from the nodev list to a
device's list in rds_ib_add_conn(), and a shutdown moves it back in
rds_ib_remove_conn().  Either can run while the sweep holds the node
on its stack list, and "the node is linked" cannot tell that list
from the nodev list - an add_conn() that went by list emptiness would
unlink the node from under the sweep's lockless walk.  So the sweep
sets the flag when it gathers the node, under ib_nodev_conns_lock,
and from then on add_conn(), remove_conn() and conn_free() leave the
node alone; the node belongs to the sweep, and its walk needs no
lock.  Those movers used to assert that the node is linked (and
rds_ib_add_conn() that the nodev list is non-empty); a connect or
shutdown worker can still be running for a connection the sweep has
claimed, and such a connection is about to be destroyed anyway, so
the assertions go, and rds_ib_add_conn() refuses a claimed node the
way it refuses a device that is shutting down, rather than attach a
connection the sweep is destroying.

For IB this also closes a race that exists today.
rds_ib_destroy_nodev_conns() spliced the nodev list onto its stack
without re-initialising the global head, and since commit
4716af3897e9 ("net/rds: Give each connection path its own workqueue")
the shutdown works that rds_ib_dev_shutdown() queues run on the
per-path cp_wq, which the flush_workqueue(rds_wq) in
rds_ib_unregister_client() no longer waits for.  A shutdown finishing
during the sweep links its node through the stale head, which points
into the stack list, so the last entry of that list now points at the
global head and the sweep's lockless walk runs off the end of its
list into it; a connect finishing then could likewise unlink a node
from under the walk.  Gathering entry by entry under
ib_nodev_conns_lock and claiming each node closes both.

The walk itself must not lose the entries either.  Once the following
patches hand out references, a connection on one of these lists can
be kept alive only by a reference that is dropped at any point during
the walk, freeing the transport node the iterator is about to read;
nothing in this tree destroys a connection behind the sweep's back
today, so that part is preparation for those patches, while the IB
list handling above is a fix in its own right.  So the gather takes a
reference on each connection it moves
onto the stack list, under the transport lock, and drops it after the
destroy; a connection whose free is already running gets no reference
and is left where it is, since that free unlinks the node itself once
the lock is released.  The tmp_list gathering itself remains: it is
what keeps rds_conn_destroy() from being called with the transport
lock held.

Fixes: 4716af3897e9 ("net/rds: Give each connection path its own workqueue")
