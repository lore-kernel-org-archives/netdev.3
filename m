can: rcar_canfd: Add support for Renesas RZ/G3L

This adds the "renesas,r9a08g046-canfd" compatible to rcar_canfd_of_table.
The new entry reuses the existing RZ/G3S hardware info, r9a08g045_hw_info.
The commit message says RZ/G3L has 3 channels, 11 interrupts and 288
buffers.

[Severity: Low]
This entry gives RZ/G3L the same handling as RZ/G3S, and that handling
expects the rstp_n and rstc_n resets. Should the binding also make those
resets mandatory for RZ/G3L?

In renesas,rcar-canfd.yaml, the block that requires them lists only three
compatibles:

  - if:
      properties:
        compatible:
          contains:
            enum:
              - renesas,r9a08g045-canfd
              - renesas,r9a09g047-canfd
              - renesas,rzg2l-canfd
    then:
      required:
        - resets
        - reset-names

The r9a08g046 block only has "resets: minItems: 2", and that rule only
applies when the property is present.

Two other rules list RZ/G3S and RZ/G3L together: the no-can-fd/fd-only ban
and the assigned-clocks exemption. This rule does not.

As a result, an RZ/G3L DT with no resets, or with resets but no
reset-names, still passes dtbs_check. rcar_canfd_probe() gets both resets
as optional:

	gpriv->rstc1 = devm_reset_control_get_optional_exclusive(dev, "rstp_n");
	...
	gpriv->rstc2 = devm_reset_control_get_optional_exclusive(dev, "rstc_n");

Either mistake in the DT returns NULL without an error. In that case
reset_control_reset(NULL) in rcar_canfd_global_init() does nothing. The IP
then stays in reset, and the GRAMINIT/GRSTSTS poll in
rcar_canfd_reset_controller() times out. The resulting probe error does not
mention the missing reset.

The later patch in this series, "dt-bindings: can: renesas,rcar-canfd:
Restrict resets in top-level", does not add r9a08g046 to this list either.

[ ... ]

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, not one introduced by this patch, but RZ/G3L
also goes through this probe error path. rcar_canfd_channel_probe() stores
the channel pointer before it registers the netdev:

	gpriv->ch[priv->channel] = priv;
	err = register_candev(ndev);
	if (err) {
		...
		goto fail_candev;
	}
	...
fail_candev:
	netif_napi_del(&priv->napi);
fail:
	free_candev(ndev);

free_candev() frees priv, because priv is netdev_priv(ndev). gpriv->ch[ch]
still points to it afterwards.

rcar_canfd_probe() then unwinds every channel in channels_mask:

fail_channel:
	for_each_set_bit(ch, &gpriv->channels_mask, gpriv->max_channels)
		rcar_canfd_channel_remove(gpriv, ch);

rcar_canfd_channel_remove() only checks for NULL:

	if (priv) {
		unregister_candev(priv->ndev);
		netif_napi_del(&priv->napi);
		free_candev(priv->ndev);
	}

When register_candev() fails, does this read priv->ndev from freed memory?
It would also call unregister_candev() on a netdev that was never
registered, then call free_candev() on the same allocation again.

Could gpriv->ch[ch] be cleared on the fail_candev path, or set only after
register_candev() succeeds?

[Severity: High]
This is also a pre-existing issue, not one introduced by this patch. It
still affects RZ/G3L, which has shared_global_irqs == 0 like RZ/G3S.

rcar_canfd_remove() frees the channels one by one while the global
interrupts are still enabled:

	for_each_set_bit(ch, &gpriv->channels_mask, gpriv->max_channels) {
		rcar_canfd_disable_channel_interrupts(gpriv->ch[ch]);
		rcar_canfd_channel_remove(gpriv, ch);
	}

	rcar_canfd_global_deinit(gpriv, true);

rcar_canfd_channel_remove() calls free_candev() but does not clear
gpriv->ch[ch]. The global interrupts are masked only later, in
rcar_canfd_global_deinit().

The g_recc and g_err IRQs come from devm_request_irq(), so they stay
registered until remove returns. The same applies to the per-channel
err/trx IRQs, which use the freed priv as dev_id.

Both global handlers loop over every channel in channels_mask and use
gpriv->ch[ch] without checking it:

rcar_canfd_handle_global_receive():
	struct rcar_canfd_channel *priv = gpriv->ch[ch];
	...
	sts = rcar_canfd_read(priv->base, RCANFD_RFSTS(gpriv, ridx));

rcar_canfd_handle_global_err():
	struct rcar_canfd_channel *priv = gpriv->ch[ch];
	struct net_device *ndev = priv->ndev;

Suppose channel 0 is already freed and channel 1 is still up. A frame
received on channel 1 then raises g_recc:

rcar_canfd_global_receive_fifo_interrupt()
  rcar_canfd_handle_global_receive(gpriv, 0)
    priv->base, priv->napi   <- channel 0, already freed

Can this cause a use-after-free in hardirq context? The g_err path looks
the same: rcar_canfd_handle_global_err() could call
rcar_canfd_global_error() on the freed ndev.

rcar_canfd_disable_channel_interrupts() only clears the CCTR error and
TX-abort enables. It does not affect the global RX FIFO interrupt.

[Severity: Medium]
This is a pre-existing issue as well, not one introduced by this patch.
rcar_canfd_global_init() already unwinds its own resources on every error
path:

fail_mode:
	rcar_canfd_disable_global_interrupts(gpriv);
fail_reset2:
	reset_control_assert(gpriv->rstc2);
fail_reset1:
	reset_control_assert(gpriv->rstc1);
fail_ram_clk:
	clk_disable_unprepare(gpriv->clk_ram);
fail_clk:
	clk_disable_unprepare(gpriv->clkp);
	return err;

rcar_canfd_probe() still sends that failure through the full deinit:

	err = rcar_canfd_global_init(gpriv);
	if (err)
		goto fail_mode;
	...
fail_mode:
	rcar_canfd_global_deinit(gpriv, false);

rcar_canfd_global_deinit() then calls rcar_canfd_disable_global_interrupts()
again, asserts both resets again, and calls clk_disable_unprepare() on
clk_ram and clkp a second time.

Are both clocks disabled and unprepared twice whenever
rcar_canfd_global_init() fails? Possible triggers are a
reset_control_reset() error, a rcar_canfd_reset_controller() timeout (as in
the missing reset case above), or the GSTS mode change timeout.

If clk_prepare_enable(gpriv->clkp) is the call that failed, the clocks are
disabled without ever having been enabled. In all of these cases, GCTR is
read-modify-written after the module clock has already been turned off.

Should the probe error path jump to fail_dev here instead?
