vxlan: vnifilter: reject VNIs outside the 24-bit space

This commit adds NLA_POLICY_FULL_RANGE validation to the
VXLAN_VNIFILTER_ENTRY_START and VXLAN_VNIFILTER_ENTRY_END attributes. Both
are limited to 0..VXLAN_N_VID - 1. It also changes the loop counter in
vxlan_vni_add_del() from int to u32, which stops the loop from running
without bound when end_vni is 0xffffffff.

[Severity: Medium]
This fixes a problem that users can trigger, but the trailers have no
Fixes: tag:

    Assisted-by: LLM
    Signed-off-by: Ali Firas <alishmery18@gmail.com>

The bare NLA_U32 policy, the int loop counter and the loop in
vxlan_vni_add_del() all come from:

    f9c4bb0b245c ("vxlan: vni filtering support on collect metadata device")

Before this patch, a single RTM_NEWTUNNEL entry with START=0xffffffff
passed the !vni_start && !vni_end check in vxlan_process_vni_filter(). The
loop then stopped only when vxlan_vni_add() failed. That means either
-ENOMEM, or -E2BIG from the rhashtable: vxlan_vni_rht_params.max_size is
VXLAN_N_VID, so the limit is about 2^25 nodes.

Each iteration allocates a vxlan_vni_node and a per-CPU stats block, does
an rhashtable insert and sends a notification, all under rtnl_lock.
RTM_NEWTUNNEL only needs CAP_NET_ADMIN in the user namespace that owns the
netns.

Should this carry a Fixes: tag for f9c4bb0b245c so that stable kernels
pick it up?

A related point: the changelog says:

    With the nest now linked to this policy, an out-of-range endpoint is
    rejected during netlink policy validation, before
    vxlan_process_vni_filter() runs and before anything is allocated.

That depends on the preceding patch, "vxlan: vnifilter: validate the
VXLAN_VNIFILTER_ENTRY nest". If this patch is backported alone, the
rejection happens in the nla_parse_nested() call inside
vxlan_process_vni_filter(). By then, earlier entries in the same message
have already been applied.

If both patches are meant for stable, could the changelog state this
dependency?

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but the FDB netlink path seems
to have the same class of problem. vxlan_fdb_parse() in
drivers/net/vxlan/vxlan_core.c only checks the length of NDA_VNI and
NDA_SRC_VNI:

	if (tb[NDA_VNI]) {
		if (nla_len(tb[NDA_VNI]) != sizeof(u32)) {
			NL_SET_ERR_MSG(extack, "Invalid vni");
			return -EINVAL;
		}
		*vni = cpu_to_be32(nla_get_u32(tb[NDA_VNI]));
	...
		*src_vni = cpu_to_be32(nla_get_u32(tb[NDA_SRC_VNI]));

The FDB get and bulk flush paths do not check the range either.

A remote_vni >= VXLAN_N_VID can be stored, and vxlan_vni_field() then drops
its top byte on transmit. A src_vni that large can never match a received
24-bit VNI.

IFLA_VXLAN_ID, vxlan_mdb.c and now vnifilter all enforce the 24-bit bound.
Would a follow-up doing the same for the FDB attributes make sense? Note
that vxlan_core.c uses cpu_to_be32(VXLAN_N_VID) internally as a sentinel
remote_vni.

[Severity: Medium]
This is a pre-existing issue, but with both endpoints capped at 0xffffff,
one entry with START=0 END=0xffffff still makes the loop in
vxlan_vni_add_del() run about 16.7M times under rtnl_lock, with no
cond_resched(). An entry with END alone does the same, because vni_start
then stays 0:

	for (v = start_vni; v <= end_vni; v++) {
		switch (cmd) {
		case RTM_NEWTUNNEL:
			err = vxlan_vni_add(vxlan, vg, v, group, extack);

Each iteration walks the netns vxlan_list in vxlan_vni_in_use(). It also
allocates a node and a per-CPU stats block with plain GFP_KERNEL, which is
not charged to memcg. A single message can carry many such entries.

The changelog leaves the span limit to the next patch, and later patches
in the series handle it:

  - "vxlan: vnifilter: bound the number of VNIs one request may touch"
    adds VXLAN_VNI_FILTER_MSG_MAX (4096). The limit is summed across all
    entries and checked in vxlan_vnifilter_check_msg() before the dispatch
    loop in vxlan_vnifilter_process().

  - "vxlan: vnifilter: account per-VNI memory to memcg" switches
    vxlan_vni_alloc() and the per-CPU stats allocation to
    GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT.

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but a reversed range still
returns success. vxlan_process_vni_filter() only rejects the case where
both endpoints are zero:

	if (!vni_start && !vni_end) {

So START=100 END=50 reaches the loop in vxlan_vni_add_del(). The body
never runs, and 0 is returned for both RTM_NEWTUNNEL and RTM_DELTUNNEL.
The new range policy checks each endpoint on its own, not their order.

Later in the series, vxlan_vnifilter_check_msg() documents this as
intended:

	/* A start above the end selects no VNI and costs nothing; leave it
	   behaving as it does today. */

The selftest in that series also checks that an inverted range is
accepted as a no-op.

Is a success reply for a request that does nothing the intended uAPI
here?

[Severity: Low]
This is also a pre-existing issue: VNI 0 is handled inconsistently. With
START=0 END=1, the zero check passes and the loop calls vxlan_vni_add() for
v == 0, which inserts VNI 0.

A later request for VNI 0 alone (START=0, or START=0 END=0) is rejected in
vxlan_process_vni_filter():

	if (!vni_start && !vni_end) {
		NL_SET_ERR_MSG_ATTR(extack, nlvnifilter,
				    "vni start nor end found in vni entry");
		return -EINVAL;
	}

The check tests the endpoint values rather than whether the attributes
are present.

As a result, VNI 0 added through a range can only be removed by another
range that covers it, or by tearing down the device. VNI 0 is otherwise
valid: IFLA_VXLAN_ID accepts it, and the minimum of the new
vni_filter_vni_range is 0.

Should this check look at whether vattrs[VXLAN_VNIFILTER_ENTRY_START] and
vattrs[VXLAN_VNIFILTER_ENTRY_END] are present instead?
