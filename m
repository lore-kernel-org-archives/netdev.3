amt: forward multicast data over IPv6

This patch makes the relay send its copy of a multicast packet through
amt_udp_xmit(), so traffic can be delivered over an IPv6 outer transport.
On IPv6 tunnels, a new helper, amt_tmtu_exceeded(), drops any payload
above the tunnel MTU and sends an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big to the source.
A copy that cannot be sent is now counted in tx_dropped and freed with a
specific drop reason.

[Severity: High]
Can one multicast packet cause up to max_tunnels Packet Too Big messages
to be sent to its source here?

amt_dev_xmit() walks the tunnel list and sends one copy to each tunnel
that joined the group. Each copy can then send its own Packet Too Big:

amt_dev_xmit()
  list_for_each_entry_rcu(tunnel, &amt->tunnel_list, list)
    amt_send_multicast_data()
      amt_udp_xmit(..., true)
        amt_tmtu_exceeded()
          icmpv6_ndo_send(skb, ICMPV6_PKT_TOOBIG, ...)

By default, nothing limits the rate of these messages.
inet6_net_init() clears ICMPV6_PKT_TOOBIG from icmpv6_ratemask, so
icmp6_send() skips both icmpv6_global_allow() and icmpv6_xrlim_allow().

amt_request_handler() creates a tunnel for any new outer source address,
with no authentication, up to max_tunnels. The commit message also notes
that a gateway can lower its own route MTU to IPV6_MIN_MTU with a Packet
Too Big that udpv6_err() accepts.

So a remote party with max_tunnels IPv6 addresses (one /64 is enough)
could join a group and lower the route MTU of each tunnel. After that,
every datagram on that group above about 1230 bytes would cause up to
max_tunnels Packet Too Big messages of about 1280 bytes each, all sent to
the multicast source.

Does this ever stop? The check uses dst_mtu() minus the outer headers,
which is about 1230 here. The reported MTU is clamped to IPV6_MIN_MTU,
which is 1280. A compliant source cannot shrink its packets below 1280,
so its packets or first fragments keep exceeding the tunnel MTU for as
long as the attacker keeps its tunnels and route MTU entries alive.

The commit message says "so a packet draws one for each gateway with a
smaller path MTU", but it does not say that untrusted gateways control
how many there are. Relays can only be created as IPv6 once a later
netlink patch in this series lands. The final state of the series still
sends one Packet Too Big per tunnel.

Would it work to send at most one Packet Too Big per original skb,
carrying the smallest failing tunnel MTU (for example tracked in
amt_dev_xmit())?

[Severity: Low]
Should this check use the inner family the caller already parsed, rather
than skb->protocol?

amt_dev_xmit() sets v6 and data from iph->version and never checks
skb->protocol:

	iph = ip_hdr(skb);
	if (iph->version == 4) {
		...
		if (!ip_mc_check_igmp(skb)) {
			...
		} else {
			data = true;
		}

If skb->protocol does not match the contents, ip_mc_check_igmp() and
ipv6_mc_check_mld() return -EINVAL. The else branch then still marks the
packet as data and forwards it, and skb_copy_expand() keeps the wrong
protocol.

Take an over-MTU skb labelled ETH_P_IPV6 that holds an IPv4 packet.
icmpv6_ndo_send() would read the IPv4/UDP header bytes as a struct
ipv6hdr, and the Packet Too Big would go to an address built from those
bytes. In the opposite case, a real IPv6 source would get no Packet Too
Big at all.

Reaching this needs something like AF_PACKET with an arbitrary
sll_protocol, or a tc/BPF redirect. Could the v6 flag from
amt_send_multicast_data() be passed down to amt_tmtu_exceeded() instead?
