It's not really mlxsw specific in any way :S
The cmode + NETIF compatibility would be my long term preference.

One note here - that's a fine position to take for downstream CIs.
But upstream / in NIPA we want to test the drivers as much as we want
to test the tests. It's _very_ useful during review to see how well 
the test works across the runners before merging. So allowlists are
explicitly a no-no for NIPA reporting.

IIRC Intel devs mentioned port split as problematic explicitly.
I also had issues with it in NIPA.

But fair point, maybe once the auto-neg / link config tests appear
upstream this will be more prevalent problem. For now devlink port
split is the only one.. let's just squirrel it away.

Thanks! I may need to respin and use PROGS_EXTENDED as AI suggests.
