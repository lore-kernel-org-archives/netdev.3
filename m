OK. I went back to Rob's v2 sketch [1] and to the RK3568 XPCS binding
that got his Reviewed-by last week [2], and the child nodes can go.
Walking the tree for the consumers of the SerDes at probe is what Rob
proposed in v2, and the SUBSYS_MODE write before reset release does not
care how the lane map was obtained. The x2 PCIe case is two phys entries
on the root port, one per lane.

The one thing the SoC does not let me derive is the XPCS instance. The
RK3568 binding derives the MII port from the GMAC when the PCS is
created, but the S32G mux is programmed at SerDes probe, before any MAC
exists, and "XPCS0 alone on lane 1" (mode 1 with the PCIe lane idle)
and "XPCS1 alone on lane 1" (mode 2) are different routings of the same
pins. So the instance has to be in the reference.

The same goes for the line rate. The 3.125 Gbit/s configurations of the
reference manual select a different SUBSYS_MODE value on SerDes_1, cap
PCIe at Gen2 on SerDes_0, need the 125 MHz reference when both lanes
run 3.125, and on S32G2 switch the second XPCS off. All of that is
decided at SerDes probe, and the MAC's phy-mode does not tell: an
in-band SGMII link to a 2.5G PHY is "sgmii" and moves to 2500BASE-X at
runtime. The next version therefore makes the SerDes a four-cell
provider, <lane type instance max-speed>, with the last two cells used
by PHY_TYPE_SGMII only and the speed being the highest the lane is
wired for, 1000 or 2500 Mbit/s. This series accepts 1000 only; 2500
will comes with the 3.125 Gbit/s modes follow-up. Putting the cell
in now avoids a #phy-cells change later.

	// mode 0: PCIe x2
	pcie0 { phys = <&serdes0 0 PHY_TYPE_PCIE 0 0>, <&serdes0 1 PHY_TYPE_PCIE 0 0>; };

	// mode 1: PCIe x1 on lane 0, GMAC0 via XPCS0 on lane 1
	pcie0 { phys = <&serdes0 0 PHY_TYPE_PCIE 0 0>; };
	gmac0 { phys = <&serdes0 1 PHY_TYPE_SGMII 0 1000>; pcs-handle = <&serdes0>; };

	// mode 3: GMAC0 via XPCS0 on lane 0, PFE_MAC2 via XPCS1 on lane 1
	gmac0    { phys = <&serdes0 0 PHY_TYPE_SGMII 0 1000>; pcs-handle = <&serdes0>; };
	pfe_mac2 { phys = <&serdes0 1 PHY_TYPE_SGMII 1 1000>; pcs-handle = <&serdes0>; };

The driver derives SUBSYS_MODE from the enabled consumers' references
to it; a lane nobody references takes the function it has in the first
matching mode. The reference clock is validated against the result as
today. No lane child nodes, no nxp,xpcs-instance.

This is implemented and runs on the RDB3, in both configurations the
board offers, with the numbers of the child-node form:

 - SerDes_1 mode 2 (PCIe_1 x1 on lane 0, PFE_MAC1 via XPCS1 on lane 1)
   plus SerDes_0 mode 3 (GMAC0 via XPCS0): the 82574L in the PCIe slot at
   880/928 Mbit/s, the shared-lane XPCS1 at 935/941, GMAC0 at 935/941,
   NIC and XPCS1 together 878 + 935, 10/10 XPCS1 link down/up under
   PCIe traffic, no AER events.

 - Both SerDes in mode 3: 941/941 and 935/941 Mbit/s on the two
   SerDes_1 lanes, 10/10 down/up on each, 0 failures in 36 partner
   speed changes on the in-band lane (100M/1G, then 100M/1G/2.5G with
   the 2.5G follow-up on top), GMAC0 up on SerDes_0.

The mode is derived from the references alone; the probe log says
"mode 2" and "mode 3" with no lane node in the tree.

Two questions before I post it:

1. The Ethernet side carries two references to the same node:
     * phys for the lane
     * pcs-handle for the PCS
   and I would rather have one. The one I want is pcs-handle
   with argument cells, <&serdes0 lane instance max-speed>, with the
   SerDes as a PCS provider for the MACs and a PHY provider for PCIe
   only. That needs dt-schema PR 198 [3], which is still open, so
   a binding written that way cannot be validated by anyone until
   the schema is released. phys only is the other way out, but a generic
   PHY reference meaning "PCS provider" is not something any binding does
   today.
   Rob, do you want the pair as above for now, with the phys
   reference going away once the cells exist, or should I post with
   pcs-handle cells and have the series wait for PR 198?

2. Rob, any objection to PHY_TYPE_SGMII covering both the 1.25 Gbit/s
   and, later, the 3.125 Gbit/s XPCS modes? The lane rate follows the
   MAC's phy-mode, so I do not plan a separate type for 2500BASE-X.

The DTS, the dwmac-s32 and the PCIe binding patches change accordingly.
On the pcs-xpcs side one value changes: the SGMII link timer written by
the S32G PMA hook becomes 0x2faf, the value the vendor driver programs
for 1G; the 0x7a1 of v3 is its 2500BASE-X value, copied by mistake. The
speed-change figures above are with the new value.
