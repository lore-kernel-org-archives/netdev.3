cases.

Document the new netlink commands for manging socket-less associations.

+An association holds the PSP device, PSP version, and either Rx state

+
+Associations are used in two ways. First, a TCP socket can be bound to

+association. Second, socket-less associations, either Rx or Tx, are
+used with tc. This allows PSP for forwarded traffic, or for non-TCP
+traffic. A tc action attaches a Tx association to packets. An Rx
+association reserves an SPI: the device decrypts packets sent to it,
+and a tc filter matches the SPI, version and PSP device a packet was
+decrypted with.

+An association is of one type or the other; that is, sockets may not

+Socket-less associations
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+Associations which are not bound to a socket are managed with these
+netlink commands:
+
+- ``rx-spi-alloc`` allocates an Rx SPI and key, like ``rx-assoc`` but
+  without a socket. It also creates an Rx association, which records the
+  SPI, the version and the device key generation, and returns its ID.
+  The key should be passed to the peer out of band, and installed with
+  ``assoc-add``.
+- ``assoc-add`` adds a Tx association with the peer's SPI and key, and
+  returns its ID.
+- ``assoc-del`` deletes an association. tc actions and packets which still
+  reference it keep it alive. The device keeps decrypting the SPI of a
+  deleted Rx association until its device key is rotated out: remove the
+  decap rule to stop taking its packets.
+- ``assoc-get`` reports associations, never their keys, and for Rx
+  associations whether key rotation has made them stale.
+
+The ``psp`` tc action attaches these associations to packets:
+
+- ``psp encap assoc ID`` attaches a Tx association. The packet must then
+  be transmitted on the main netdev of the association's PSP device, which
+  encrypts it (``mirred egress redirect``). If the association is removed
+  before transmit, or if the packet is transmitted on any other device,
+  it will be dropped, rather than sent in the clear. Encap on ingress is
+  hardware offload only.
+
+- ``psp decap`` removes the PSP Rx state (the ``SKB_EXT_PSP`` extension and
+  ``skb->decrypted``) of a decrypted packet, so that it can be forwarded. It
+  takes no association. Its filter should match ``psp_spi``, ``psp_ver``
+  and ``psp_dev``.
+
+The flower classifier matches what a packet was decrypted with:
+``psp_spi SPI[/MASK]``, ``psp_ver VERSION`` and ``psp_dev DEV_ID``, the
+ID of the PSP device which decrypted it. These never match a clear text
+packet, so ``psp_spi 0/0`` matches any packet decrypted with PSP.
+Together they tie a decap rule to one Rx association.
+
+Once the device key an SPI was created from has been rotated twice, that
+association is considered stale. Unlike sockets, tc does not handle key
+rotation. userspace should replace such rules before two rotations.
+
+The device adds 40 bytes to each packet on transmit: the UDP and PSP
+headers, and the ICV. The operator must size the MTU of the traffic
+source for this. A packet which would not fit the PSP device's MTU once
+encapsulated is dropped on transmit.

+
+Statistics
+----------
+
+The ``get-stats`` netlink command reports the PSP device statistics:
+kernel statistics (key rotations, stale events), and the device statistics
+defined by the PSP specification. The device statistics count what the
+device decrypts and encrypts.
+
+The tc action counts the packets it processes and the ones it drops
+(``tc -s``). Encapsulated packets dropped on transmit count in the
+device's ``tx_dropped``. Drops are reported with these drop reasons:
+
+- ``SKB_DROP_REASON_PSP_OUTPUT``: encap ran on ingress in software, or
+  failed to parse the packet, or it is an IPv4 fragment or has IPv6
+  extension headers, which transport mode doesn't support, or it is
+  already encapsulated for a tunnel, already marked decrypted, or of a
+  socket with its own encryption offload; or an encapsulated packet
+  reached a device which isn't its PSP device's netdev, or its PSP
+  device was unregistered while it was queued.
+- ``SKB_DROP_REASON_PKT_TOO_BIG``: an encapsulated packet would not fit
+  the device's MTU once the device adds the PSP encapsulation.

+A packet encapsulated on egress which lost its association on the way is
