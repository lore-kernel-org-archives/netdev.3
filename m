The hooks were merged into the LSM tree on August 31st, and due to
timing I'm guessing they appeared in linux-next the next day,
September 1st.  Considering the merge window opened on October
18th/19th, that's conservatively a month and a half during which
testing could have uncovered this issue and the behavior of the hook
could have been changed to accommodate your use-case.  I know the
Landlock folks were testing the hooks for their usage, but I've gone
back through my inbox and I don't see any reports of BPF LSM failures
using these new hooks in v7.4 until you posted this patchset during
the merge window.

The LSM namespace hooks are new to Linux v7.4, they did not exist in
Linus' tree prior to this merge window which is why I consider both
the BPF LSM and Landlock usage of these hooks to be "new".

As mentioned previously, I'm pretty consistent about what goes up to
Linus once the merge window opens: there is the initial pull-request
with the changes from the last development cycle and then after that
I'm pretty strict about only serious bugs/panics and regressions.  In
this case there is no existing LSM support for namespace controls in
any of the tagged releases from Linus so there are no regressions, and
by all accounts there are no panics related to these new hooks as-is.

Holding this change for Linux v7.5 will give you and others a chance
to fully test the new LSM hooks from a BPF LSM perspective, something
that evidently didn't happen during the Linux v7.4 development cycle.
Disabling the BPF LSM support for the new hooks in Linux v7.4 should
be relatively easy, much simpler than this patchset, and eliminate any
claimed harm.

Also, as the ongoing friction between the LSM and BPF developers was
brought up, I want to point out that SELinux support for the new LSM
namespace hooks was delayed to Linux v7.5 due to issues uncovered with
these new hooks during the Linux v7.4 development cycle (well before
the merge window opened).

I told you "next merge window", which is far from "no".  Considering
no one tested the BPF LSM support for these new hooks during the v7.4
development cycle, that seems pretty reasonable to me.

First, please read what I wrote above about SELinux being in a similar
situation.  If a LSM which identified an issue with the hooks well
before the merge window is being pushed to Linux v7.5, I'm not going
to make an exception and rush a functional change for a LSM that
didn't identify an issue until *after* the merge window opened when it
could have been easily identified with testing during the Linux v7.4
dev cycle.

I'm not going to argue that there isn't ongoing friction between the
BPF and LSM devs, and I'll admit to finding it odd that you seem to
keep inserting yourself into that friction point, but my approach here
is the same as what I would have taken with any other LSM (and have in
this particular case).
