net: stmmac: unwind partially allocated DMA configurations

This commit lets the RX and TX DMA free paths handle partially allocated
queues, and releases RX resources when TX allocation fails. It propagates
xdp_rxq_info_reg_mem_model() errors and clears XSK RXQ bindings. It also
frees any saved partial RX skb and NULLs the released resource pointers.

[Severity: Low]
This problem already existed before this patch, but is the XSK pool bound
here to an xdp_rxq that is about to be freed?

On the stmmac_open() path, __init_dma_rx_desc_rings() works on the
temporary dma_conf from stmmac_setup_dma_desc(). __stmmac_open() then
copies that conf:

	memcpy(&priv->dma_conf, dma_conf, sizeof(*dma_conf));

After that, stmmac_open() calls kfree(dma_conf). Nothing rebinds the pool
to &priv->dma_conf.rx_queue[queue].xdp_rxq, so the pool's rxq pointers
seem to point into freed memory.

The next patch in the series, "net: stmmac: keep DMA configurations at
stable addresses", appears to fix this. It keeps the allocated dma_conf
and removes the memcpy.

[Severity: Medium]
Now that this error is returned, how do the per-queue callers handle it?

stmmac_enable_rx_queue() returns void. When this call fails, it releases
the queue and returns:

	ret = __init_dma_rx_desc_rings(priv, &priv->dma_conf, queue, GFP_KERNEL);
	if (ret) {
		__free_dma_rx_desc_resources(priv, &priv->dma_conf, queue);
		netdev_err(priv->dev, "Failed to init RX desc.\n");
		return;
	}

With this patch, __free_dma_rx_desc_resources() also sets buf_pool,
dma_rx, dma_erx and page_pool to NULL. After that,
stmmac_xdp_enable_pool() and stmmac_xdp_disable_pool() in stmmac_xdp.c
carry on as usual:

		stmmac_enable_rx_queue(priv, queue);
		stmmac_enable_tx_queue(priv, queue);
		napi_enable(&ch->rx_napi);
		napi_enable(&ch->tx_napi);

Both return 0, so NAPI can run on a released RX queue whose ring pointers
are NULL. stmmac_xdp_set_prog() also ignores the return value of
stmmac_xdp_open().

These callers already behaved this way for the -ENOMEM return from
stmmac_alloc_rx_buffers(). This patch adds a second way to reach it.

Two later patches in the series appear to fix this: "net: stmmac: account
for failed live XDP reopening" and "net: stmmac: use the tracked datapath
restart for XSK pool changes". They check the stmmac_xdp_open() result
and remove the per-queue enable helpers.

[Severity: High]
Can this free an skb that the driver no longer owns?

This free assumes that state_saved means the driver still owns
rx_q->state.skb. However, stmmac_rx() does not clear the saved state when
it takes it:

drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/stmmac_main.c:stmmac_rx() {
    ...
		if (!count && rx_q->state_saved) {
			skb = rx_q->state.skb;
			error = rx_q->state.error;
			len = rx_q->state.len;
		} else {
			rx_q->state_saved = false;
    ...
}

state_saved is only cleared in the else branch, which runs on a later
iteration with count > 0. With limit == 1, the first iteration can finish
the restored skb. It can pass it to napi_gro_receive(), or free it on the
error path:

		if (unlikely(error)) {
			dev_kfree_skb(skb);
			skb = NULL;
			count++;
			continue;
		}

count is now 1, so the while (count < limit) loop exits. The save block
after the loop is skipped, because skb is NULL and the last descriptor
did not have rx_not_ls set:

	if (status & rx_not_ls || skb) {
		rx_q->state_saved = true;
		rx_q->state.skb = skb;
		...
	}

state_saved stays set, and state.skb points to an skb that was freed or
handed to the stack. A later poll that hits a DMA-owned descriptor right
away breaks before using the skb and saves the same stale pointer again,
so the stale pointer can survive across polls.

No privileges are needed to get a budget of 1. The EPIOCSPARAMS ioctl in
fs/eventpoll.c only requires CAP_NET_ADMIN when busy_poll_budget >
NAPI_POLL_WEIGHT, and stmmac_napi_poll_rx() passes the budget straight to
stmmac_rx(). A frame that spans several descriptors needs a jumbo MTU.

Suppose the interface is then closed (ndo_stop -> free_dma_desc_resources)
or the XSK pool or XDP program is changed. __free_dma_rx_desc_resources()
then calls dev_kfree_skb_any() on the stale pointer. Before this patch,
teardown dropped the stale pointer without freeing it.

The stale state in stmmac_rx() is older than this patch, and so is its
reuse on the next poll. This patch adds a new path that frees it a second
time. A later patch in the series copies the same pattern into
stmmac_reinit_dma_desc(), and stmmac_rx() is still unchanged at the end
of the series.

Could stmmac_rx() clear rx_q->state_saved and rx_q->state.skb as soon as
it takes the saved state?

[Severity: Low]
This one also predates the patch: stmmac_enable_rx_queue() and
stmmac_enable_tx_queue() do not unwind in the same way. When
__alloc_dma_rx_desc_resources() fails:

	ret = __alloc_dma_rx_desc_resources(priv, &priv->dma_conf, queue);
	if (ret) {
		netdev_err(priv->dev, "Failed to alloc RX desc.\n");
		return;
	}

Does this leak the page_pool, buf_pool and descriptor memory that were
already allocated? stmmac_enable_tx_queue() has the same early return,
which would leak tx_skbuff_dma, tx_skbuff and the TX descriptor memory.

"net: stmmac: use the tracked datapath restart for XSK pool changes",
later in the series, removes both helpers. After that, pool changes go
through stmmac_xdp_open() and alloc_dma_desc_resources().
