Subject: [PATCH net v5 3/7] net/rds: clear cp_flags bits individually in rds_conn_path_reset()

rds_conn_path_reset() wipes the whole flag word with a plain
cp->cp_flags = 0 store.  Every other accessor of that word uses
atomic bitops, and some of them can run concurrently with the reset:
RDS_LL_SEND_FULL is set from rds_send_xmit() and cleared from the
transport completion paths, neither of which holds anything that
excludes the shutdown worker.  A plain store racing an atomic
read-modify-write on the same word is a data race, and whichever
side loses has its update silently discarded.

Clear the two bits the reset is actually responsible for instead.
RDS_IN_XMIT and RDS_RECV_REFILL need no store at all here: they
belong to the caller, rds_conn_shutdown(), which waits for both to be
clear before calling the transport shutdown and this reset.

This also gives every bit in cp_flags a single well-defined writer
discipline, which the following patches rely on when they turn
RDS_IN_XMIT and RDS_RECV_REFILL into bit locks held across the
teardown: a blanket store mid-teardown would destroy lock ownership
that an atomic clear preserves.

Oracle UEK carries the same conversion ("net/rds: Preserve essential
connection state flags"), motivated by its asynchronous shutdown
state machine, whose progress and destroy flags must survive the
reset.  UEK's variant also clears RDS_IN_XMIT and RDS_RECV_REFILL
because there the reset runs as the final step of a teardown that
owns both bits, making those clears its unlock.  Upstream that
release belongs in rds_conn_shutdown(): once a later patch in this
series turns the two bits into locks held across the teardown, ending
ownership needs release semantics and a wake-up that a plain clear
inside the reset would not provide.

Based on Oracle UEK commit "net/rds: Preserve essential connection
state flags" by Gerd Rausch.
