This is correct. I will add the proper checks in the ipv6 case so we can
refuse configution which pushes the total size above the hardware limitatio=
n
of 16.

>=20

Also correct and both consequences follow. But i do not think swapping
the writes is quite enough. That would solve a disabled entry being enabled=
.
But a live entry with new MAC programmed, or live entry with a real MAC
being programmed to trap. But we can disable the entry during the update.
Disabled entries which are hit, get redirected to the CPU.

After both MAC registers have been programmed, we can enable the entry. Thi=
s
should solve all the cases.

>=20

No, they do not match, and yes it can. Both directions are as you describe:=
 a
gateway route with an unresolved neighbour is reported offloaded while ever=
y frame
is trapped, and LOCAL/PROHIBIT/UNREACHABLE are reported as offloaded and tr=
apped
simultaneously. nh->trapped is only ever read at one place today, as an
optimisation to skip a redundant hardware write:

        if (nh->trapped && !entry_connected)
                return;

so it never reaches the flags. I will fix the offload flags.

This is correct, I will check vrule_id_valid, and stop clearing it on error=

It was not validated anywhere, no. Both of the scenarios are prevented in v=
3 by
the nexthop group bounded added for your earlier comment, since ecmp_size i=
s now
confined to 1..16.

Yes, same issue and same fix. sparx5_rr_nexthop_group_put() reaches
sparx5_rr_nh_grp_arp_tbl_grp_clear(), which both disables the entries and c=
alls
sparx5_rr_arp_tbl_grp_free() to release them in arp_tbl_mask, so the orderi=
ng
matters here exactly as it does in the conversion path.

They do, and this is fixed in v3 using the mlxsw helpers as reference.

Correct on both counts, fixed for v3.

Yes it can, and this is the same defect as your counted_by comment on
sparx5_rr_nexthop_group_info_init() and your ECMP_CNT comment on
sparx5_rr_lpm_arp_ptr_create(). It is bounded in v3.

>=20

I think this is right. VRF is intentionally not implemented here, but
more works needs to be done to properly refuse the configurations. A leg
will not be admitted on an l3mdev slave, and moving an already offloaded le=
g
into an l3mdev is refused, since NETDEV_PRECHANGEUPPER can be vetoed on the=
 linking
path.

This is a similar strategy as with vlan_filtering transitions. Refuse a tra=
nsition
that would break a live offload, and simply do not offload a configuration =
that was
already in that state.

Yes, I think this is needed. I will add a fib dump flush.
