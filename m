Alexandra,

Four things in the RFC were wrong. Two of them change what I asked you to
decide, so they go first.

The data races. I called them that on the strength of herd7, and that was
wrong. sk_state is volatile unsigned char skc_state, and LKMM raises its
data-race flag only when one side of a conflict is a plain access, so a
volatile access never qualifies. My litmus encoded the writes as plain, whi=
ch
manufactured the flag - and the flag was the only thing separating the bug =
arms
from the fixed ones. That set did not show what I said it showed. I rebuilt=
 it
three times and every rebuild described code that does not exist; the last =
one
paired a writer that only fires on the classic transport with a waker that =
only
fires on HiperSockets, which no single socket can be. There is no replaceme=
nt
litmus. The unsynchronized writes are still unsynchronized and that part re=
ads
straight from the source.

"The owner check plus re-enqueue fixes the state machine against
close/bind/listen/shutdown". It does not fix close. iucv_sock_close() sets
IUCV_CLOSING at :417 and then, when !err and skbs_in_xmit is non-zero at :4=
20,
sleeps in iucv_sock_wait() for IUCV_CLOSED. That macro does release_sock()
before schedule_timeout() and lock_sock() after, so sk_lock.owned is clear =
for
the whole sleep, up to IUCV_DISCONN_TIMEOUT. A sock_owned_by_user() check i=
n a
softirq writer reads false across that window, and release_sock() would dra=
in a
deferred write into it on the way out. Option A orders the tasklet against =
a
process context holding the lock and does nothing for one sleeping inside i=
t.
Tell me if I have misread iucv_sock_wait().

"Stage 2 affects the core and the four other iucv users". It doesn't have t=
o.
Below.

The hardware caveat was too broad. iucv_packet_type is registered with
dev_add_pack() on every af_iucv init and carries no .dev, so an ETH_P_AF_IU=
CV
frame on any netdev reaches afiucv_hs_rcv, and the dispatch from there bran=
ches
only on trans_hdr->flags. The softirq sk_state writers are drivable in a pl=
ain
s390x guest. What needs your hardware is the classic transport and the real
qeth TX-completion contexts.

m to

> Less invasive is attractive.

Yes, with one ordering constraint and one shortcut.

The constraint is stage 1, which you already signed off on. Option A can't
order the tasklet against the reader until recvmsg holds the socket lock:
recvmsg sets no sk_lock.owned today, so the deferral branch has nothing to =
test
and never fires against it. Stage 1 is a prerequisite for stage 2, not a
parallel track.

The shortcut removes the cost you flagged in f558120cd709, "this may requir=
e
adding return values to the tasklet functions and thus changes to all users=
 of
iucv". struct proto has .release_cb, and net/smc already uses it
(smc_release_cb). af_iucv can set iucv_proto.release_cb and keep a per-sock=
et
mask of pending state changes: af_iucv.c plus one field in af_iucv.h, no re=
turn
values, nothing in net/iucv/iucv.c, and monreader, vmlogrdr, smsgiucv and
hvc_iucv untouched.

I prototyped it on an s390x kernel: a writer that finds sock_owned_by_user(=
)
true sets a bit instead of touching sk_state, and release_sock() applies it=
 --
sk_state 1 -> 5, defer flags cleared. Synthetic __init probe, not the real
handler path; it shows the deferral vehicle works, nothing more. Log on req=
uest.

release_cb runs under sk_lock.slock with BH disabled, so whatever gets defe=
rred
there must not sleep. Writing sk_state and waking the state-change waiters =
is
fine.

Agreed, and I'd drop that alternative. Worth adding that message_q.lock alr=
eady
reaches further than it should on that path: iucv_sock_recvmsg() calls
iucv_send_ctrl() with it held, and iucv_send_ctrl() allocates through
sock_alloc_send_skb(), which uses sk->sk_allocation - GFP_KERNEL for these
sockets. On a default-msglimit HiperSockets socket the msglimit/2 gate fire=
s at
64 receives, so it's not a corner case. I have a DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP splat f=
or
it from an s390x guest, from the same __init probe as above with msg_recv s=
et
rather than received: the state is staged, the sleeping allocation under
spin_lock_bh is not.

The check belongs there, and I'd put it in with the lock rather than before=
 it.
Unlocked it narrows the window without closing it: iucv_sock_close() clears
hs_dev under lock_sock while recvmsg holds nothing, so the gap between the =
test
and iucv_send_ctrl() stays open. It becomes sound once recvmsg holds the so=
cket
lock, which is where stage 1 puts it.

iucv_send_ctrl() has one more defect at that call site, independent of the
locking: five callers, and this is the only one not gated on the transport,=
 so a
classic z/VM socket sends a HiperSockets control frame it has no device for=
. It
sizes the skb via LL_RESERVED_SPACE(iucv->hs_dev), afiucv_hs_send() returns
-ENODEV on a null skb->dev, and recvmsg turns that into IUCV_DISCONN. It ta=
kes
SO_MSGLIMIT set to 1 to get there: msg_recv is only incremented on the
HiperSockets path, so on a classic socket it stays zero and the msglimit/2 =
test
passes only when msglimit is 1. On a guest booted without relocate_lowcore =
the
read through the null hs_dev lands in the mapped lowcore instead of faultin=
g,
which is why I saw a spurious disconnect and not an oops; with lowcore
relocation that read would fault.

> This is a tough one. Maybe we need to add a context parameter to qeth_not=
ify_skbs() ?

Yes, and one of the two obvious candidates doesn't work.

qeth_notify_skbs() has two calling functions. qeth_iqd_tx_complete() reache=
s it
three times and has a single caller, qeth_tx_poll(), so it is NAPI only.
qeth_tx_complete_pending_bufs() reaches it once and has two callers:
qeth_drain_output_queue() with drain=3Dtrue, and qeth_tx_poll() with drain=
=3Dfalse.
The drain path is the only non-NAPI reach, so drain is already an exact
discriminator at that call site and it's in scope there. budget is not:
netpoll calls napi->poll(napi, 0) from atomic context, so budget =3D=3D 0 h=
appens on
both sides. qeth_tx_complete_buf() on the next line passes budget to
napi_consume_skb(), correct there and wrong here.

No single primitive covers both contexts, which is why the parameter is
unavoidable: bh_lock_sock() is a plain spin_lock() on sk_lock.slock with no=
 BH
disable, so it's unsafe from the drain path, and lock_sock() sleeps, so it'=
s
unsafe from NAPI. sk_txnotify is an af_iucv/qeth private pointer, so the
signature change touches af_iucv.h, af_iucv.c and qeth_core_main.c and none=
 of
the four other iucv_handler users.

I also read your reply on Nagamani PV's afiucv_netdev_event() patch, and I =
agree
with the call. The notifier runs in process context, so lock_sock() is avai=
lable
there; the two-line fix closes the traversal use-after-free and leaves
sk->sk_state =3D IUCV_DISCONN and sk->sk_state_change() in the loop body wi=
th no
socket lock. I had that site filed as stage 3, on the assumption it needed =
a
lock chosen for it. Process context makes it the same shape as stage 1 -
lock_sock, owned_by_user, backlog - so it folds into the combined fix.

> That would be great, we are also working on several small fixes. Let's ge=
t them out of the way.

The connack patch is written: bh_lock_sock() in iucv_callback_connack(), th=
e one
site whose context is unambiguous, since connrej and shutdown run in the sa=
me
tasklet and already take it. Fixes: eac3731bd04c - the function has held no=
 lock
since 2007. checkpatch --strict is quiet and it builds for s390x. Which tre=
e do
you want it against?

You already answered the only thing I would have asked for: you will valida=
te
any revision. The analysis I can do here; z/VM and real HiperSockets I can'=
t,
and QEMU is not z/VM, so machine_is_vm() is false and the classic transport=
 is
not reachable at all. If you would rather own the stage 2 change yourselves=
,
take it.

Thanks,
Bryam
