Yes, as discussed in your initial patch, I am aware that iucv_sock_recvmsg is
currently not protected.

I understand. Yes, that would be the way to go.

I understand. I'm not sure I can judge all the implications, but your proposal makes
sense to me.

I wonder, if there is more required than taking and releasing the socket lock.
e.g. I think recvmsg needs to check (sk->sk_state == IUCV_CONNECTED) before
iucv_send_ctrl(sk, AF_IUCV_FLAG_WIN).
But let's take it one by one.

Sounds good to me

That would be great, we are also working on several small fixes. Let's get them out of the way.

No, I don't like that. message_q is a concept for iucv not HS - I see message_q.lock
is already used in both paths, but I don't want to stretch it further.
I prefer your proposal above and would like to test it with KASAN etc.

I would prefer option A: keep the tasklet and use bh_lock_sock(). You seem to
think that is doable?
Less invasive is attractive.

This is a tough one. Maybe we need to add a context parameter to qeth_notify_skbs() ?

Yes, we will validate any revision.

Thanks again for working on this. You identified several workitems, are there any
where you would prefer me or Hidayath to work on?
Otherwise we will continue with issues that are not on this list and work on
running and improving our testcases.
