Subject: [PATCH net v3 3/5] net/rds: tcp: don't force RDS_CONN_RESETTING over a concurrent shutdown

From: Gerd Rausch <gerd.rausch@oracle.com>

rds_tcp_reset_callbacks() resolves a duelling SYN by storing
RDS_CONN_RESETTING into cp_state unconditionally.  Nothing serializes
that store against the shutdown path: rds_tcp_accept_one() checks
for RDS_CONN_CONNECTING or RDS_CONN_ERROR under t_conn_path_lock, but
neither rds_conn_path_drop(), which forces RDS_CONN_ERROR, nor
rds_conn_shutdown(), which moves the path to RDS_CONN_DISCONNECTING
under cp_cm_lock, takes that lock.  The store can therefore land on
top of a shutdown that is already in progress, or that gets queued
right after the accept-side check.

When it does, the shutdown worker's final DISCONNECTING -> DOWN
transition fails and the path goes through rds_conn_path_error() and
a second drop/shutdown cycle instead of a clean reconnect, tearing
down the socket the accept path has just installed.  Before commit
ad22d24be635 ("net/rds: No shortcut out of RDS_CONN_ERROR") a path
found in RDS_CONN_RESETTING even made rds_conn_shutdown() bail out
altogether.

Make the transition conditional: move CONNECTING -> RESETTING (or
stay in RESETTING from an earlier duel), and drop the path in any
other state.  The drop has side effects of its own: it replaces the
shutdown's RDS_CONN_DISCONNECTING (or RDS_CONN_ERROR) with
RDS_CONN_ERROR and queues one more cp_down_w run.  The difference is
that rds_conn_shutdown() accepts RDS_CONN_ERROR in its final
transition to RDS_CONN_DOWN, so the shutdown in flight completes
normally instead of through rds_conn_path_error(); the extra
down-work pass then finds the path already down and falls through to
the reconnect check, or catches a reconnect that has already started
and restarts it.  The accept path still installs the new socket,
rds_connect_path_complete() then fails its RESETTING -> UP transition
and drops it: the raced socket ends up torn down as it does today.

The state can change again between the failed transitions and the
drop.  That is inherent to rds_conn_path_drop(), which the socket
state-change callbacks also call unconditionally, and costs at most
one extra drop/reconnect cycle.

Based on Oracle UEK commit "net/rds: Don't force state
RDS_CONN_RESETTING" by Gerd Rausch.

v3: comment and changelog now say what the fallback drop actually
    does (replaces the shutdown's state with RDS_CONN_ERROR, which
    rds_conn_shutdown() tolerates, and queues one more down-work pass)
    instead of claiming the shutdown state is left untouched; note that
    the state can move again before the drop and why that is benign
v2: new in this version, port of an Oracle UEK fix for the
    accept-vs-shutdown state race
