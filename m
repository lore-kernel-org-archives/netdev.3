Actually, I think the port might be the complete fix.  With both call sight=
s guarded,
there's no need to check t_mp_capable again, since rds_recv_hs_exthdrs is o=
nly
reachable when all paths are allocated.  rds_conn_peer_gen_update is only r=
eachable
through rds_recv_hs_exthdrs, so that case is taken care of, and then the WA=
RN and xmas
tree complaints disappear with it.

I'd recommend a v3 that's just the port.  Since the upstream code here matc=
hes UEK
almost exactly. =C2=A0Keep the original authors, but drop the internal RVBs=
 and orabug
tags, and add your SOB.  Keep your change log and the KASAN repro plus the =
fixes tags
and add another Fixes: 905dd4184e07 ("RDS: TCP: Track peer's connection gen=
eration number")
for the WARN.

The other pre-existing bugs are real, but I think they should be separate f=
ollowups. The
work queue leak will need a separate counter in struct rds_connection as th=
e review
suggests, but i dont think this fix should be held up over it since it's no=
t directly
related to the out-of-bounds bug here.

It's worth noting a lot of the pre-existing bugs having to do with the gene=
ration number
would disappear with the removal of the generation number:
https://github.com/oracle/linux-uek/commit/1bf4a2a29c8e
But that's a bigger effort that should probably go to next-next at a later =
time.=20

Thanks again for working on this! I wouldn't have initially prioritized tha=
t port since
the original commit makes no mention of an OOB, but your find made verifyin=
g it much
faster.
