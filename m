ibmveth: Complete set_channels down-path and mq_fallback max_rx cap

This commit allows ethtool -L to change the RX count while the device is
down. The new count is published without allocating anything, and on the
live path RX is rolled back if TX fails. It also caps max_rx at the live
count under mq_fallback, raises the max_tx ceiling to at least the live
TX count, and guards ibmveth_poll_controller() with adapter->opened.

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but "Patch 14" and "patch 14's temporary -EOPNOTSUPP"
are series positions. They won't mean anything once this lands in git
history. Could they refer to the earlier commit by its subject instead?

The subject covers only the down path and the mq_fallback max_rx cap.
The patch also carries two further independent changes:

> max_tx is at least the live tx_count. After CPU offline,

[ ... ]

> Guard poll_controller() with adapter->opened so netpoll cannot walk
> unallocated queue state while closed.

After CPU offline, the max_tx change in ibmveth_get_channels() and
ibmveth_set_channels() lets ethtool -l report a max_tx above the online
CPU count. The ibmveth_poll_controller() guard is a separate netpoll
change.

Would splitting these out make bisecting and selective backporting
easier?

[Severity: Low]
When mq_fallback is set and the live RX count N is above 1, this reports
max_rx = N. The ethtool core only compares rx_count against max_rx:

net/ethtool/channels.c:ethnl_set_channels() {
    ...
	if (channels.rx_count > channels.max_rx)
		err_attr = ETHTOOL_A_CHANNELS_RX_COUNT;
    ...
}

A request for any value in 2..N-1 therefore reaches the driver.
ibmveth_resize_rx_channels() then rejects it:

	if (goal_rx > 1 && (!adapter->multi_queue || adapter->mq_fallback)) {
		...
		return -EOPNOTSUPP;
	}

That leaves 1 and N as the only RX counts set_channels accepts, while
get_channels advertises 1..N. For example, ethtool -l can show a max of
8, but ethtool -L dev rx 4 fails with "Operation not supported".

This state can be reached after ibmveth_replenish_task() or a scale-up
register failure sets mq_fallback. It lasts until the next
ibmveth_open() applies the fallback.

The commit message says the cap "blocks growth". Doesn't it also block
shrinking within the advertised range? Could get_channels and
set_channels be made to agree on what is settable?

[Severity: Medium]
Can raising num_rx_queues here leak a stranded subordinate RX queue?

Stranded queues (queue_handle[i] still set above the live count) are
reclaimed only in ibmveth_close(), and only if H_FREE_LOGICAL_LAN
succeeds:

	if (!ibmveth_free_all_queues(adapter))
		ibmveth_free_stranded_rx_queues(adapter);

That helper also only scans indices at or above the live count:

	for (i = ibmveth_get_num_rx_queues(adapter);
	     i < IBMVETH_MAX_RX_QUEUES; i++) {
		if (!adapter->queue_handle[i])
			continue;

Consider a live scale-up where H_REG or IRQ setup fails and the
per-queue H_FREE also fails. If the following close then fails
H_FREE_LOGICAL_LAN, the strand survives with opened == false. This new
down path can then lift num_rx_queues above that index, which moves it
out of the scan range.

On the next open, ibmveth_alloc_rx_queues() overwrites the pointers
without checking them:

	for (i = 0; i < ibmveth_get_num_rx_queues(adapter); i++) {
		adapter->buffer_list_addr[i] =
			(void *)get_zeroed_page(GFP_KERNEL);

The same applies to rx_queue[i].queue_addr/queue_dma and
buffer_list_dma[i]. Wouldn't the old page, the coherent RX ring, the DMA
mappings and the pool buffers for that index be leaked?

The live path guards against this in ibmveth_scale_up_rx_queues():

		if (adapter->queue_handle[i]) {
			/* Left by a failed H_FREE; close frees it. */
			netdev_err(netdev,
				   "RX queue %d still held by PHYP, reset pending\n",
				   i);
			rc = -EBUSY;

Should the down path apply the same queue_handle[] check before
publishing a larger count? Before this patch, an RX count change while
down returned -EOPNOTSUPP, so this path was not reachable.

[Severity: Low]
This reads adapter->opened as a plain bool from netpoll context. That
context can run concurrently with direct ibmveth_close()/ibmveth_open()
calls from ibmveth_change_mtu() and veth_pool_store(), which don't call
netpoll_poll_disable().

The writers are plain stores as well:

ibmveth_open():
	adapter->opened = true;

ibmveth_close():
	adapter->opened = false;

Isn't this an unannotated data race that KCSAN would report? Could the
accesses use READ_ONCE()/WRITE_ONCE(), or smp_store_release() and
smp_load_acquire()?

The close side looks fine, because opened is cleared before
synchronize_net() and netpoll runs with IRQs disabled or under RCU-bh.

On the open side, though, nothing explicitly orders the queue, pool and
NAPI setup before opened = true. Today it relies on the replenish_lock
unlock in open and on the acquire of num_rx_queues in the reader. Would
it be worth making that pairing explicit, so that reordering open()
later can't break the guard?
