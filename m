ipv6: icmpv6: don't quote decrypted payload in icmpv6 errors

This patch changes icmp6_send() so that ICMPv6 errors no longer quote
device-decrypted data. For a received kTLS skb, the quote is cut off at
the end of the TCP header and the RFC 4884 extension is dropped. For a
received PSP skb, no error is sent. A locally originated decrypted skb
is only quoted when its source address is local.

[Severity: High]
Does this cover all the places that build ICMPv6 errors from a decrypted
skb? nf_reject_skb_v6_unreach() in net/ipv6/netfilter/nf_reject_ipv6.c
builds its own Destination Unreachable and never goes through
icmp6_send():

net/ipv6/netfilter/nf_reject_ipv6.c:nf_reject_skb_v6_unreach() {
    ...
	len = min_t(unsigned int, 1220, oldskb->len);
    ...
	skb_put_data(nskb, skb_network_header(oldskb), len);
    ...
}

It has no skb_is_decrypted() check. Two live callers use it:

nft_reject_netdev_send_v6_unreach()
    nf_reject_skb_v6_unreach()
    nft_reject_queue_xmit()
        dev_queue_xmit()

nft_reject_br_send_v6_unreach()
    nf_reject_skb_v6_unreach()
    br_forward()

Say a PSP or kTLS RX decrypted skb hits a netdev or bridge reject rule.
Could the error then carry up to 1220 bytes of the decrypted TCP header
and payload in cleartext? nskb is a fresh allocation without ->decrypted
set, so sk_validate_xmit_skb() would not drop it.

The IPv4 patch in this series also seems to leave
nf_reject_skb_v4_unreach() unchanged. No later patch in the series
touches net/ipv6 or net/netfilter.

Should these builders be handled here as well, or in a companion fix?

[Severity: Medium]
The commit message covers the inner tunnel decap case. Can plain
transport-mode PSP packets also lose SKB_EXT_PSP before reaching this
check? With bpf_redirect_peer into another netns:

net/core/filter.c:skb_do_redirect() {
    ...
		skb_scrub_packet(skb, false);
    ...
		skb->dev = dev;
		dev_sw_netstats_rx_add(dev, skb->len);
		return -EAGAIN;
}

__netif_receive_skb_core() then goes back to another_round, which sets
skb->skb_iif again. skb_scrub_packet() calls skb_ext_reset() but leaves
skb->decrypted set.

An error about that packet in the peer netns, for example from a reject
rule via nf_send_unreach6()->icmpv6_send(), would take the kTLS branch
here. The quote would then include the full TCP header: ports, seq/ack,
window and options, up to doff * 4 bytes. With PSP transport mode those
bytes were encrypted on the wire.

kTLS RX device offload is tied to the socket's offload netdev, so a
decrypted skb seen after a scrub is most likely PSP. Would it be safer
to use the PSP behaviour in that case?

[Severity: Low]
This check runs after icmpv6_xrlim_allow(). When apply_ratelimit is
true, that function has already taken an inet_peer token and called
icmp_global_consume():

net/ipv6/icmp.c:icmpv6_xrlim_allow() {
    ...
			peer = inet_getpeer_v6(net->ipv6.peers, &fl6->daddr);
			res = inet_peer_xrlim_allow(peer, tmo);
    ...
		icmp_global_consume(net);
    ...
}

So an error that is suppressed here still uses up per-peer and global
ICMPv6 credit. One trigger is a locally originated kTLS/PSP skb with a
non-local source (freebind, or a deleted address) hitting DEST_UNREACH.

The IPv4 patch in this series makes the same skb_iif / RTCF_LOCAL
decision in __icmp_send() before icmpv4_xrlim_allow(). There, a
suppressed error costs no credit.

IPv6 already spends credit when icmpv6_route_lookup() fails after
xrlim, so this is a small effect. Is the difference between the two
families intended?
