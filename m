Yeah I can see this both ways. It makes sense to only expose functions
to the scope that currently needs them, but I think Matthew's right that
moving it to internal.h does kinda signal "this is private, don't touch
this" which isn't intended.

FWIW I suspect the "proper" design requirements are something like:

1. We want some flags that we can happily squeeze into places like
   struct xa_node, and other flags that we can add bits to relatively
   freely.

2. We want some flags that are "public" and some that are "private",
   although this is intentionally vaguely defined.

The current ALLOC_/GFP_ flags split is something that kinda inelegantly
attempts to solve both at once even though they are actually probably
orthogonal requirements. Do we care about this inelegance? I think it's
pretty harmless.

Another thing that's pretty inelegant about it is that both sets of
flags percolate into the allocator at once. This is quite
confusing/tiresome when you are reading page_alloc.c (I tried to
ameliorate that with [0]) but I don't think it has much of an
architectural impact?

oogle.com/

In the back of my mind I suspect the "neat and tidy" solution would be
something like: a single flags namespace that is split into two separate
enums, one "public" and one "private", and then a separate mechanism to
"compress" these flags into a small number of bits. But yeah I'm just
not sure working on that nice elegant cleanup would really unlock
anything of practical value. Boring little cleanups like "split out this
API from internal.h into its own header" seem like more useful ways to
spend refactoring energy in this space.

Quite likely I'm missing potential unlocks though. E.g. maybe there's
some place we currently put a gfp_t that could benefit from a "separate
compression mechanism" that could usefully shrink it to 8 bits or
whatever.

Well, for ALLOC_UNMAPPED we really do need an alloc_flags arg for this
function, but we can always just go straight to what I described above.
I.e. I can create the __ variant + wrapper from the start. It's just a
question of whether we prefer:

- "Yuck, there's a public wrapper here that we don't actually need", or

- "We hid this mempolicy API and people might think we'd NACK a patch to
  un-hide it".0
