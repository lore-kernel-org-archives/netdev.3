Subject: [PATCH net-next v20 00/10] net: dsa: Add Airoha AN8855 support

This series add the initial support for the Airoha AN8855 Switch.

It's a 5 port Gigabit Switch with SGMII/HSGMII upstream port.

This is starting to get in the wild and there are already some router
having this switch chip.

MT7530 is generalized with reg fields to a shared library to
reduce code duplication and reuse all the logic for AN8855.

There is this special thing where PHY needs to be calibrated with values
from the switch efuse. (the thing have a whole cpu timer and MCU)

Given the double usage of PHY and Switch accessor, a special handling
is used with registering a mdio-regmap bus for each internal PHY.

From v8 Driver is now evaluated with Kernel selftest scripts for DSA:

Additional info about the test bridge_vlan_aware.sh.

It was discovered that the Airoha Switch (and probably the Mediatek one
that produce the same test results) hardcode checking for 802.1ad when
the port is configured in VLAN-Aware mode (aka Security mode).

In such mode, both 802.1q and 802.1ad TPID are checked, hence the
bridge_vlan_aware.sh test fails as packets with 802.1ad TPID are rejected
(in the case where a wrong VLAN ID is forwarded)

This was confirmed by Airoha and multiple try were done to try to
workaround this problem. No solution were found to this as ACL mechanism
can't work on receiving packets and the Switch doesn't support turning off
this.

The current driver is in use from 4 month on OpenWrt with all kind of
scenario confirming working in VLAN bridge. By tweaking the
bridge_vlan_aware.sh test with setting the TPID to 0x9100, the test
correctly pass as packets gets classified as untagged and the default PVID
applied. It's also confirmed that switch correctly parse the 802.1ad tag
and make the packet pass only when allowed by VLAN table rules.
