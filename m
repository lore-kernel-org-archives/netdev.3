selftests: dpll: add pin state tests

This adds dpll_features.sh. It moves a spare input pin through the pin
states of the device mode and checks each readback, either on a dpllsim
device it creates or on a device chosen through DPLL_DEV_ID or
DPLL_DRIVER. The stress script gains a pin state flooding test, and
dpll_lib.sh gains a state setter, a device mode getter and a check for
the pin set keywords the dpll tool supports.

[Severity: Low]
Is this description accurate? Nothing in the script seems to skip based
on whether the device is a dpllsim one.

The only simulator-specific check in test_pin_state_transitions()
depends on DPLL_CREATED_DEVICE, not on the module name:

	if [ "$mode" = automatic ] && [ -n "$DPLL_CREATED_DEVICE" ]; then

So a dpllsim device passed through DPLL_DEV_ID silently loses that
check, and no skip line is logged.

Also, dpll_lib_init() clears DPLL_DEV_ID when DPLL_DRIVER=dpllsim:

	elif [ "${DPLL_DRIVER:-}" = "dpllsim" ]; then
		DPLL_DEV_ID=""

So that setting always creates a new simulator device instead of running
against an existing one. The header is still the same at the end of the
series.

[Severity: Medium]
Do these two deferred commands run in the order the comment describes?

defer_scope_pop() in net/lib/sh/defer.sh runs deferred jobs in reverse
order, last in first out:

	for ((defer_ix=$(__defer__ndefers d); defer_ix-->0; )); do
		__defer__run d $defer_ix
	done

tests_run() wraps every test in in_defer_scope(), so both commands run
after every test, including one that passed. In manual mode the
sequence would be:

  test body restores PIN_TUNE_ID to $before and reconnects $ref_pin
  test body finds $ref_pin connected, log_test reports a pass
  defer_scope_pop() -> dpll_pin_set_state ... "$ref_pin" connected
  defer_scope_pop() -> dpll_pin_set_state ... "$PIN_TUNE_ID" disconnected

On zl3073x, ZL_DPLL_MODE_REFSEL_MODE_REFLOCK is reported as manual
mode. In that mode, zl3073x_dpll_input_pin_state_on_dpll_set() handles a
disconnect request on any input pin by leaving the reference:

	case ZL_DPLL_MODE_REFSEL_MODE_REFLOCK:
		...
		} else if (state == DPLL_PIN_STATE_DISCONNECTED) {
			/* Choose new mode based on lock status */
			switch (zldpll->lock_status) {
			...
				mode = ZL_DPLL_MODE_REFSEL_MODE_FREERUN;

The dpll core does not skip a set that matches the current state.

Could this last deferred disconnect of the test pin leave the device in
holdover or freerun after the test has already reported a pass?

That would also contradict the commit message:

  "connects it back at the end and checks that it is the reference
  again"

An interrupted run has the same ordering problem. The reconnect of
$ref_pin runs while PIN_TUNE_ID may still be the selected reference,
and PIN_TUNE_ID is disconnected afterwards.

Would registering the $ref_pin defer before the PIN_TUNE_ID one give
the intended order? This code is still the same at the end of the
series.

[Severity: Medium]
Can this skip hide a failure that an earlier iteration recorded?

Suppose the first state is set but reads back differently, so check_err
records a failure. If the second set is then refused on a user-provided
device, dpll_log_test_skip_or_fail() calls log_test_skip(), which does:

	RET=$ksft_skip retmsg= log_test "$@"

The test then reports a skip and the earlier failure message is lost.

The restore path further down guards against this with
[ "$RET" -eq 0 ], and the comment above the loop says "a skip would
hide the earlier one". The loop path has no such check.

[Severity: Medium]
In automatic mode, can the selectable step change the reference the
device is locked to?

When PIN_TUNE_ID starts out disconnected, setting it selectable puts it
back into hardware selection with its configured priority. ice enables
the input in ice_dpll_input_state_set():

	bool enable = state == DPLL_PIN_STATE_SELECTABLE;

zl3073x restores pin->prio in the hardware priority table.

If the pin outranks the current reference and has a valid signal, the
DPLL would switch to it. The restore to disconnected would then switch
it back.

The commit message says the pin is picked "so that no test touches the
reference the device is locked to". However, pick_tune_pin() only looks
at the state, not at priority or operstate.

On ice, ice_dpll_pin_state_update() reports the active input as
connected:

	pin->state[pf->dplls.eec.dpll_idx] =
		pin->pin == pf->dplls.eec.active_input ?
		DPLL_PIN_STATE_CONNECTED :
		DPLL_PIN_STATE_SELECTABLE;

Would this readback then fail with "pin not selectable, state
'connected'", depending on how the board's priorities are set up?

[Severity: Medium]
On zl3073x, could this pick the reference the device is locked to?

In automatic mode, zl3073x_dpll_input_pin_state_on_dpll_get() never
reports connected:

	case ZL_DPLL_MODE_REFSEL_MODE_AUTO:
		if (zl3073x_chan_ref_is_selectable(chan, ref))
			*state = DPLL_PIN_STATE_SELECTABLE;
		else
			*state = DPLL_PIN_STATE_DISCONNECTED;

So the active reference reads as selectable and passes this filter.
pick_tune_pin() prefers a qualifying pin other than input_pins[0], so it
would pick the locked reference whenever that reference is not the first
dumped pin.

test_pin_state_transitions() then sets the pin disconnected. The
ZL_DPLL_MODE_REFSEL_MODE_AUTO branch of
zl3073x_dpll_input_pin_state_on_dpll_set() handles that like this:

			/* Set pin priority to none in HW */
			zl3073x_chan_ref_prio_set(&chan, ref,
						  ZL_DPLL_REF_PRIO_NONE);

That drops the active reference.

Devices that do report the active input as connected have a related
gap. The state is checked only once here, before any test runs.
test_pin_state_transitions() reads $before again but does not reject
connected in automatic mode. A hardware reselection between
pick_tune_pin() and the test would therefore go unnoticed.

Would checking the pin operstate (active or standby), and checking again
right before the first set, avoid touching the locked reference? This
code is still the same at the end of the series.

> +		PIN_TUNE_ID=$pin_id
> +		[ "$pin_id" != "${input_pins[0]}" ] && return
> +	done
> +}

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but the commit message and the comment above
pick_tune_pin() don't match this code.

The commit message says the script picks:

  "the first input pin that is not connected on the device"

This early return, however, prefers any qualifying pin other than
input_pins[0].

The comment explains that choice with "the one a simulated device locks
to once it is selectable". dpllsim_pin_state_set() only stores the
state, though:

	sim_pin->state = state;
	return 0;

Nothing in dpllsim selects a reference or changes the lock status from
its initial unlocked value.

Could the comment and the commit message be updated?

[Severity: Low]
Can this readback catch a state setter that does nothing? With i running
from 1 to 50, the last request is states[50 % 2], which is disconnected.

dpllsim_pin_reset() initialises every pin to that same state:

	pin->state = DPLL_PIN_STATE_DISCONNECTED;

On a freshly created device, a state_on_dpll_set that returned 0 without
storing anything would still pass. The fails counter only catches
non-zero returns. The test is still the same at the end of the series.
