For the case of USB and co. it's also still fine - just perhaps wants 
some clearer wording - since the endpoint itself is not performing DMA 
operations. It might send some message which causes the host controller 
device to DMA to/from a buffer owned by the host controller driver, but 
that's perfectly OK since the host controller itself is not on its own 
bus, and must have already been accepted by the PCI/platform/whatever 
code to get to that point.

Now if we had some bonkers kind of bus where the only way to identify an 
endpoint was to give it DMA addresses to have it read a command 
descriptor and write out its own data directly, then indeed there would 
be little hope of being able to enforce much of a trust model for that...

Thanks,
Robin.
