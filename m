selftests/bpf: Track test_xdp_features DUT processes

This reworks test_xdp_features.sh so the device-under-test xdp_features
server is tracked by pid and job spec instead of being matched by name with
pidof, replaces the readiness poll loop with a bounded retry loop, and moves
teardown to an EXIT trap plus explicit signal traps.

A few questions on the new shell logic below.

[Severity: Low]
Should this carry a Fixes: tag?  Both defects repaired here came in with
the original script.

In the baseline, wait_for_dut_server() ran the failing command in the body
of the loop:

	while sleep 1; do
		ss -tlp | grep -q xdp_features
		[ $? -eq 0 ] && break
	done

errexit exempts only the loop condition, so with set -e a DUT that is not
yet listening after one second aborted the script instead of retrying.

Also, trap cleanup 2 3 6 9 never trapped EXIT (and signal 9 cannot be
trapped), while cleanup was only reached at the end of a fully successful
run, so every [ $? -ne 0 ] && exit path left the netns, the v1 veth and a
live xdp_features process behind, and the leftover v1 then makes the next
run's ip link add v1 fail.

git blame attributes both constructs to 4dba3e7852b7 ("selftests/bpf:
introduce XDP compliance test tool"), so a
Fixes: 4dba3e7852b7 ("selftests/bpf: introduce XDP compliance test tool")
trailer would let this be selected for the affected history.

[Severity: Medium]
Can this cleanup() tear down a veth pair that belongs to a different
instance of the script?

The host side name in setup() is fixed:

	ip link add v1 type veth peer name v0 netns ${NS}

If instance A is mid-test and instance B starts, B's ip link add v1 fails
because the name is taken.  With set -e that exits B, which now fires the
newly added trap cleanup EXIT and runs:

	ip link del v1 2> /dev/null || true

deleting A's interface while A is still using it.  The baseline never ran
cleanup on that path, since the old trap covered only signals 2/3/6/9.

Since the commit message gives "avoid interference between concurrent
tests" as the motivation, should teardown only remove interfaces this
invocation actually created, and should the veth name (and the fixed DUT
control/echo ports) become per-invocation like ${NS} already is?

Note the follow-on patch "selftests/net: Move XDP feature test to driver
framework" deletes this script and moves the test to the NetDrvEpEnv
framework, which does not create a fixed v1 veth, so this may only matter
for the intermediate state of the series.

[Severity: Medium]
Is a ten second budget enough here, and should exceeding it kill the whole
run?

wait_for_dut_server() is the last command of start_dut_server(), so its
return 1 becomes that function's status, and with set -e in effect the
script terminates at the first feature case, skipping XDP_DROP,
XDP_ABORTED, XDP_TX, XDP_REDIRECT and XDP_NDO_XMIT.

The loop also sleeps after its last observation (check at i=9, then
sleep 1, then return 1), so readiness is only sampled over roughly the
first nine seconds and the tenth second is dead time.  The DUT only reaches
listen() after xdp_features__open()/__load() has verified all the XDP
programs, which on KASAN/lockdep kernels or a busy CI host can take longer
than that.

The changelog mentions only "Fix readiness retries under set -e", with no
mention of the new deadline.  Could the retry budget be documented in the
changelog, and could a timeout fail just the current case rather than the
whole script?

The later patch "selftests/net: Move XDP feature test to driver framework"
removes this loop in favour of the framework's
bkg(..., ksft_ready=True) handshake, so this too is limited to the
intermediate state of the series.

[Severity: Medium]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but while the result handling is
being reshuffled: does this script ever notice a mismatch between the
detected and the advertised XDP capability?

Every case in test_xdp_features(), including this last one, derives its
result purely from the exit status of the tester process.  In
tester_run() in xdp_features.c the two values only reach stdout:

	fprintf(stdout, "Feature %s: [%s][%s]\n", get_xdp_feature_str(),
		detected_cap ? GREEN("DETECTED") : RED("NOT DETECTED"),
		env.feature.drv_feature & advertised_feature ? ...

detected_cap and advertised_feature are never compared and never influence
the returned status, so a driver that advertises a feature it does not
implement still passes.

The follow-on patch "selftests/net: Move XDP feature test to driver
framework" closes this by adding xdp_features.py with
ksft_eq(detected, advertised, ...), so at the end of the series the gap is
gone.

>  set -e
> -trap cleanup 2 3 6 9
> +trap cleanup EXIT
> +trap 'exit 129' HUP
> +trap 'exit 130' INT
> +trap 'exit 131' QUIT
> +trap 'exit 134' ABRT
> +trap 'exit 143' TERM

[Severity: Low]
Should cleanup() disarm the traps on entry, for example with
trap - EXIT HUP INT QUIT ABRT TERM?

The signal traps stay armed while the EXIT trap runs, and bash does not
block signals during a trap handler.  cleanup() starts with
terminate_dut_server(), which can block in wait "$pid", so a second
Ctrl-C or SIGTERM in that window dispatches the signal trap's exit and
bash terminates without resuming or re-entering the EXIT trap:

	cleanup() {
		terminate_dut_server      <-- second signal arrives here
		ip link del v1 ...        <-- never runs
		ip netns del "${NS}" ...  <-- never runs
	}

That leaves the v1 veth and the netns behind, which is the state the new
trap machinery is meant to avoid.

As with the other comments, the following patch deletes this script, so
this only applies to the intermediate state of the series.
