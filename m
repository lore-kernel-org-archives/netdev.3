psp: defer tx key deletions for SADB drivers

This commit enables Tx rekey on devices that keep Tx keys in an SADB. A
superseded Tx key is now deleted only after a BQL-based descriptor grace
period has passed on every active Tx queue, and a delayed work polls the
queued and completed byte counts to detect the end of that period.
CONFIG_INET_PSP now depends on CONFIG_BQL, and SADB drivers must be ops
locked.

[Severity: Low]
Should this list also say that psp_dev_unregister() must not be called
with the netdev instance lock held? Right now that rule is only in the
commit message.

psp_dev_unregister() now begins with psp_deferred_del_stop(), which waits
for the work:

psp_deferred_del_stop() {
	disable_delayed_work_sync(&psd->tx_del.work);
}

The work takes psd->lock first and then the instance lock:

psp_deferred_del_work() {
	...
	mutex_lock(&psd->lock);
	netdev_lock(psd->main_netdev);
	...
}

Suppose a driver calls psp_dev_unregister() under netdev_lock() while the
work is blocked in netdev_lock(). Then disable_delayed_work_sync() never
returns. Taking psd->lock after that would also invert the psd->lock ->
instance lock order.

The psp_dev_unregister() kernel-doc has no Context: line covering this.
The @tx_key_add / @tx_key_del kernel-doc in include/net/psp/types.h still
only says "Can be left NULL if device does not store Tx keys". It doesn't
say that psp_dev_create() now rejects tx_key_add on devices that aren't
ops locked, and it doesn't mention the BQL requirements.

mlx5 calls psp_dev_unregister() from mlx5e_nic_cleanup() without holding
netdev_lock, so it isn't affected today.

[Severity: Medium]
With this check removed, can an unprivileged user use up the device's Tx
key space by calling tx-assoc in a loop on a single socket?

The PSP_CMD_TX_ASSOC op in psp-nl-gen.c sets only GENL_CMD_CAP_DO and not
GENL_ADMIN_PERM. The caller just needs to own an established TCP socket
routed over an SADB device. Every rekey allocates a new device key:

psp_nl_tx_assoc_doit()
  psp_sock_assoc_set_tx()
    psp_sock_tx_rekey()
      psp_assoc_set_tx()
        psp_dev_tx_key_add()
          mlx5e_psp_assoc_add()
            mlx5_create_encryption_key()

The superseded key is released only after all of these steps:

- an RCU grace period
- the free work runs
- psp_deferred_del_queue() moves it onto psd->tx_del.next
- a BQL grace period completes on every Tx queue

psp_deferred_del_work() checks for the end of that grace period only once
every PSP_TX_GRACE_POLL_MS (1000 ms).

Nothing limits the rekey rate or the length of tx_del.next and
tx_del.active:

psp_deferred_del_queue() {
	...
	list_move_tail(&pas->assocs_list, &psd->tx_del.next);
	schedule_delayed_work(&psd->tx_del.work, 0);
}

If a Tx queue stops completing its snapshotted bytes (for example, the
peer sends link-level pause frames), the grace period never ends. In that
case tx_del.next keeps growing and new device keys keep being allocated.

Every PSP socket on the device shares these keys, and they aren't charged
to the caller's memcg (only the psp_assoc allocation uses
GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT). Once they run out, tx_key_add() fails for every
other user of the device.

The commit message says:

  Adding a time based rate limit per socket for tx-assoc to prevent
  wasting SADB or deferred deletion queue space is possible for future
  work. For now, users should avoid presenting PSP devices to users they
  don't trust to abuse this.

Before this patch, a socket on an SADB device could hold only one Tx key.
There also doesn't seem to be an in-kernel way to limit tx-assoc to
trusted users. The rest of the series only adds selftests, so no later
patch adds a bound.

Could this patch cap the number of pending deferred deletions per device
or per socket, or rate limit Tx rekey, instead of leaving that for later?
