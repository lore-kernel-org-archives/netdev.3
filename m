sctp: linearize GSO skb when frag_list skbs are shared

This patch widens the linearization condition in sctp_rcv(). GSO packets
whose frag_list head skb is shared are now linearized as well. The aim is
to stop SCTP from working in place on frag_list skbs shared through
pskb_copy() (for example by the TEE target), which can end in a BUG_ON in
__pskb_pull_tail().

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but the comment above this block still gives CRC cost
as the only reason to linearize:

    /* If the packet is fragmented and we need to do crc checking,
     * it's better to just linearize it otherwise crc computing
     * takes longer.
     */

The new frag_list clause only matters when is_gso is true. In that case
sctp_rcv_checksum() is skipped anyway. The clause is there for
correctness, not for CRC speed.

Could the comment be updated to say that GSO packets with shared frag_list
skbs must be linearized?

[Severity: High]
Is it enough to check only the first frag_list member here?

pskb_copy() goes through __pskb_copy_fclone()->skb_clone_fraglist(),
which takes a reference on every member of the chain:

net/core/skbuff.c:skb_clone_fraglist() {
	skb_walk_frags(skb, list)
		skb_get(list);
}

So after nf_dup_ipv4()->pskb_copy() in the TEE target, every frag_list
member is shared, not only the head.

Something may pull into the frag_list before sctp_rcv() runs. Examples
are nft_payload_set_eval() or tcf_pedit_act() through
skb_ensure_writable(), and bpf_skb_pull_data(). In that case
__pskb_pull_tail() forks a partially eaten shared head:

net/core/skbuff.c:__pskb_pull_tail() {
    ...
				if (skb_shared(list)) {
					/* Sucks! We need to fork list. :-( */
					clone = skb_clone(list, GFP_ATOMIC);
					...
					insp = list->next;
					list = clone;
				}
    ...
		/* Free pulled out fragments. */
		while ((list = skb_shinfo(skb)->frag_list) != insp) {
			skb_shinfo(skb)->frag_list = list->next;
			consume_skb(list);
		}
		/* And insert new clone at head. */
		if (clone) {
			clone->next = list;
			skb_shinfo(skb)->frag_list = clone;
		}
    ...
}

The pulled copy then has a private clone at the head of its frag_list,
while the later members still have users == 2. Because consume_skb() drops
a reference on the old head, the twin skb's head also goes back to
users == 1. An eat that consumes whole leading members ends in the same
state.

Both outer skbs stay uncloned with is_gso true. The new check therefore
returns false in both of them and skb_linearize() is skipped.

sctp_inq_pop() then walks the chain and calls skb_pull() on each member:

net/sctp/inqueue.c:sctp_inq_pop() {
    ...
			if (chunk->skb->next) {
				chunk->skb = chunk->skb->next;
				goto new_skb;
			}
    ...
			skb_pull(chunk->skb, chunk->chunk_end - chunk->skb->data);
    ...
	skb_pull(chunk->skb, sizeof(*ch));
    ...
}

It also writes SCTP_INPUT_CB() into those members. Can the two SCTP
receive paths, possibly on different CPUs, end up changing data, len and
cb of the same shared sk_buff structs?

Suppose either copy is linearized later, for example because a tap made
it skb_cloned(), or because of another pull into the frag_list. Then
__pskb_pull_tail()->skb_copy_bits() walks members whose len has already
been reduced. Would that still return -EFAULT and hit
BUG_ON(skb_copy_bits(...)), the same panic this patch is meant to fix?

The commit message talks about sharing of "the frag_list skbs" in general,
but the check only looks at the head. Should this walk every member with
skb_walk_frags() and linearize if any of them is skb_shared()?

[Severity: Medium]
Does linearizing an SCTP GSO skb here lose the per-segment boundaries
that the SCTP-AUTH check depends on?

On transmit, sctp_packet_pack() builds each GSO segment in its own nskb
and appends it to skb_shinfo(head)->frag_list. When the association
uses AUTH, the HMAC is computed over that single nskb only:

net/sctp/output.c:sctp_packet_pack() {
    ...
		if (auth) {
			if (sctp_auth_calculate_hmac(tp->asoc, nskb, auth,
						     packet->auth->shkey, gfp)) {
    ...
}

After skb_linearize() the frag_list is gone. sctp_inq_pop() then no
longer sets chunk->head_skb, and it treats all the concatenated
segments as one SCTP packet. When sctp_sf_authenticate() checks the
first AUTH chunk, it passes chunk->skb to sctp_auth_calculate_hmac(),
which hashes up to the tail of the whole linear buffer:

net/sctp/auth.c:sctp_auth_calculate_hmac() {
    ...
	data_len = skb_tail_pointer(skb) - (unsigned char *)auth;
    ...
}

That range now covers every following segment as well, so the digest
cannot match. sctp_sf_authenticate() returns SCTP_IERROR_BAD_SIG, and
sctp_sf_pdiscard() discards the remaining chunks, which now means all
segments of the GSO packet.

The existing skb_cloned() leg already behaves this way. The new clause
extends it to every GSO packet whose frag_list was shared by
pskb_copy(). If I read nf_dup_ipv4() right, with the TEE target that
includes the original skb that keeps going to the local socket, not
only the duplicate. skb_clone_fraglist() takes a reference on members
that both skbs point to, so both see a shared frag_list head. On
loopback or veth with AUTH enabled, a TEE rule would then turn the
BUG_ON into silent drops of authenticated traffic.

Would it be better to unshare the frag_list members instead, for
example by replacing each shared member with a private copy, so the
segments stay separate? Or is there another way to get an exclusive
copy without merging the segments into one SCTP packet?
