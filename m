net: wan: lapbether: validate frame length and headroom in lapbeth_rcv() and xmit

This changes lapbeth_rcv() to use pskb_trim_rcsum() instead of skb_trim()
when trimming the received frame to the length carried in the 2-byte
prefix, drops the frame if the trim fails, and moves the rx_packets and
rx_bytes accounting to after the trim.

A few questions below about the commit message and about the length
handling.

[Severity: High]
The commit message describes two changes that do not appear in the diff:

  "call pskb_may_pull() before reading the 2-byte length prefix in
   lapbeth_rcv() and ensure sufficient headroom in
   lapbeth_data_transmit()"

The pskb_may_pull() call is already there before this patch, in
lapbeth_rcv():

	if (!pskb_may_pull(skb, 2))
		goto drop;

git blame attributes that to 1da177e4c3f4 ("Linux-2.6.12-rc2"), and the
diff adds no pskb_may_pull() call at all.

lapbeth_data_transmit() is not touched by the diff either, and the 2 bytes
it pushes are already accounted for in lapbeth_new_device():

	/* When transmitting data:
	 * first this driver removes a pseudo header of 1 byte,
	 * then the lapb module prepends an LAPB header of at most 3 bytes,
	 * then this driver prepends a length field of 2 bytes,
	 * then the underlying Ethernet device prepends its own header.
	 */
	ndev->needed_headroom = -1 + 3 + 2 + dev->hard_header_len
					   + dev->needed_headroom;

Could the changelog be rewritten to describe what the patch actually does,
namely the skb_trim() to pskb_trim_rcsum() conversion, the new drop path
and the relocated receive counters?

Relatedly, is the Fixes: 1da177e4c3f4 ("Linux-2.6.12-rc2") tag correct
here? As written it points at an unchecked length-prefix read that the
patch does not change, which may lead to this being picked up for stable
as a memory-safety fix.

[Severity: High]
Does this actually validate len against what was received?

len comes straight off the wire, and pskb_trim_rcsum() returns success
without looking at the skb whenever the requested length is not smaller
than the current one:

include/linux/skbuff.h:pskb_trim_rcsum() {
	skb_might_realloc(skb);
	if (likely(len >= skb->len))
		return 0;
	return pskb_trim_rcsum_slow(skb, len);
}

So for a frame whose prefix declares more bytes than were actually
received, the new check returns 0, no trim happens, and the untrimmed skb
(including any Ethernet minimum-frame padding) is handed to
lapb_data_received(). Only the shrink path can fail, via
pskb_trim_rcsum_slow() returning -EINVAL for CHECKSUM_PARTIAL or -ENOMEM
from __pskb_trim.

The transmit side in the same file defines the prefix as the real payload
length:

	int size = skb->len;

	ptr = skb_push(skb, 2);

	*ptr++ = size % 256;
	*ptr++ = size / 256;

Would an explicit check be closer to what the subject line promises?

	if (len > skb->len)
		goto drop_unlock;

> +
> +	dev->stats.rx_packets++;
> +	dev->stats.rx_bytes += len;

[Severity: High]
Can a sender on the same Ethernet segment inflate rx_bytes here? len is
the declared length, not the number of bytes received, and per the above
it is never rejected when it is too large.

A ~60-byte frame declaring 65535 adds 65535 to dev->stats.rx_bytes, which
does not match the rtnl_link_stats64 definition of rx_bytes as good
received bytes corresponding to rx_packets. Would counting skb->len after
the trim be more accurate?

[Severity: Medium]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch (the device selection dates back
to ea2ebaf822ad7), but since these two lines are being moved anyway: is dev
the intended netdev here? dev is the Ethernet device the packet_type
handler was called on, while the transmit counterpart charges the LAPB
device:

lapbeth_data_transmit() {
	ndev->stats.tx_packets++;
	ndev->stats.tx_bytes += size;
}

The result is that ip -s link show lapb0 reports transmit counters but
never any rx_packets/rx_bytes, since the receive path reaches the axdev
only through lapb_data_received() -> lapbeth_data_indication() ->
netif_receive_skb_core(), which does not touch dev->stats.

There is also the question of who owns that counter block. dev->stats is a
plain non-atomic struct net_device_stats belonging to the Ethernet driver,
and this read-modify-write is serialized only by lapbeth->up_lock, which
that driver does not take:

	spin_lock_bh(&lapbeth->up_lock);
	...
	dev->stats.rx_packets++;
	dev->stats.rx_bytes += len;

Can this lose increments against the Ethernet driver's own dev->stats
updates, or produce torn rx_bytes on 32-bit? Would lapbeth->axdev->stats be
the right target?
