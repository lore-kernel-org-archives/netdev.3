bpf, sockmap: Check the target of an egress redirect before each send

This adds tcp_bpf_redir_allowed() and calls it in tcp_bpf_push() before
each tcp_sendmsg_locked() call made for an egress redirect. The redirect
fails with -EINVAL when the target has no struct socket or is still
connecting, and with -EPIPE after close(). It also clears MSG_FASTOPEN in
tcp_bpf_sendmsg(), so a redirect cannot enter the target's connect code.

[Severity: Medium]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but the comment mentions
unaccepted children as redirect targets. Can tcp_bpf_push_locked() hold
the lock of such a child while the listener tears it down?

A sockops BPF_SOCK_OPS_PASSIVE_ESTABLISHED_CB program can put a child that
is still in the accept queue into a sockmap. sock_map_sk_state_allowed()
accepts TCP_ESTABLISHED:

    return (1 << sk->sk_state) & (TCPF_ESTABLISHED | TCPF_LISTEN);

The redirect sender then does:

tcp_bpf_push_locked()
    lock_sock(sk);
    ret = tcp_bpf_push(sk, msg, apply_bytes, flags, uncharge);
    release_sock(sk);

If the listener is closed in that window, inet_csk_listen_stop() does:

    bh_lock_sock(child);
    WARN_ON(sock_owned_by_user(child));
    sock_hold(child);

Then inet_child_forget() disconnects, orphans and destroys the child
without waiting for the lock owner.

Would the sender's release_sock() then run __release_sock() and
tcp_release_cb() on the torn-down child?

bpf_tcp_ingress() takes lock_sock() on the target in the same way. This
patch makes the egress window shorter, because the lock is now held only
long enough to find sk_socket == NULL and return -EINVAL. The race itself
seems to remain.

[Severity: Low]
Does this change the errno that non-blocking senders see? Every target in
TCP_SYN_SENT is rejected, whatever the sender's timeout is. One example is
a sockmap member that disconnected and then reconnected.

Before this patch, a sender using MSG_DONTWAIT got timeo == 0 in
tcp_sendmsg_locked(). sk_stream_wait_connect() then returned before
add_wait_queue():

net/core/stream.c:sk_stream_wait_connect() {
    ...
		if (!*timeo_p)
			return -EAGAIN;
    ...
}

So this case never reached the remove_wait_queue() path. Now tcp_bpf_push()
returns -EINVAL before it calls tcp_sendmsg_locked(), so a retryable EAGAIN
becomes EINVAL.

The commit message says the redirect fails "when the sender has to wait
for the connection". A non-blocking sender never waits, though.

Could non-blocking senders keep getting -EAGAIN here? If not, could the
commit message mention the errno change?

[Severity: Medium]
This check only runs before each tcp_sendmsg_locked() call. Suppose
tcp_sendmsg_locked() sleeps in sk_stream_wait_memory() on an accepted
ESTABLISHED target, and the owner calls close(). sock_orphan() then clears
sk_wq:

    write_lock_bh(&sk->sk_callback_lock);
    sock_set_flag(sk, SOCK_DEAD);
    sk_set_socket(sk, NULL);
    sk->sk_wq  = NULL;

On wakeup, the loop in sk_stream_wait_memory() goes back to:

	while (1) {
		sk_set_bit(SOCKWQ_ASYNC_NOSPACE, sk);

Can this dereference a NULL sk_wq_raw when SOCK_FASYNC is set on the
target?

The commit message says so: "sk_stream_wait_memory() has this test, but
it can still use sk_wq after the sleep. This patch does not change that."

The next patch in the series, "net: Leave sk_stream_wait_memory() once the
socket is dead", adds this right after sk_wait_event():

		if (ret < 0 || sock_flag(sk, SOCK_DEAD))
			goto do_error;

After that, the retry check here returns -EPIPE. So the window exists only
at this commit, or in a backport that takes this patch without the next
one.

Could the series be reordered so that fix lands first?

The out: label also skips remove_wait_queue() for a dead socket, which
leaves the on-stack wait entry on the old queue. That skip predates this
series, and no waker was found that could still walk that queue.

[Severity: Medium]
This is a pre-existing issue, but it is related to the sleep above. Is a
redirect sender that sleeps in sk_stream_wait_memory() on the target woken
at all when the target's owner closes it?

In the default close path, __tcp_close() does:

    WRITE_ONCE(sk->sk_shutdown, SHUTDOWN_MASK);

Then it calls tcp_close_state() and tcp_send_fin(), or tcp_set_state(TCP_CLOSE)
plus a reset when data was unread, and then sock_orphan(). None of these
wakes sk_sleep(sk). Only the tcp_disconnect() paths call
sk_error_report().

After sock_orphan(), sk_stream_write_space() does nothing:

	if (__sk_stream_is_writeable(sk, 1) && sock) {

tcp_done() also skips sk_state_change() for a SOCK_DEAD socket.

The sender would then stay in TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE until the target's
sk_sndtimeo expires (MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT by default) or a signal arrives.
All that time it pins the target sock (sock_hold() in
tcp_bpf_send_verdict()) and its psock (sk_psock_get() in
tcp_bpf_sendmsg_redir()).

The check added here runs before tcp_sendmsg_locked(), so it can't help a
sender that is already asleep inside it. The SOCK_DEAD exit added later in
the series only helps after a wakeup, so the hang seems to remain once the
whole series is applied.

[Severity: Low]
This clears MSG_FASTOPEN for every psock send. That includes __SK_PASS to
the sender's own socket in tcp_bpf_send_verdict():

    ret = tcp_bpf_push(sk, msg, tosend, flags, true);

The fallback without a psock keeps the flag:

	if (unlikely(!psock))
		return tcp_sendmsg(sk, msg, size);

So the same sendmsg(MSG_FASTOPEN) on a connected socket returns -EISCONN
without a psock and succeeds with one. Is that difference intended?

The commit message does describe it ("send() with MSG_FASTOPEN sends the
data. Today it fails with EISCONN."). It also matches the behaviour before
c5c37af6ecad, when do_tcp_sendpages() ignored MSG_FASTOPEN.

tcp_bpf_push() builds its msghdr with no msg_name, so a fastopen connect
could never succeed on this path anyway. This may well be fine as is.

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but the comment above still says "Don't let internal
flags through". The mask now also clears MSG_FASTOPEN, which is a UAPI
send flag rather than an internal one.

The reason for clearing it is that the target's connect code uses
sk_socket and sk_wq without a file reference. That reason is only in the
commit message, and the comment on tcp_bpf_redir_allowed() does not
mention MSG_FASTOPEN.

Could the comment be updated to say why MSG_FASTOPEN is cleared?
