Subject: [PATCH net-next v10 03/13] net/rds: ib: refuse to attach a connection to a device being removed

rds_ib_remove_one() drops every connection on the device's conn_list
in rds_ib_dev_shutdown(), then clears the client data so that no new
connect can find the device.  A connect that is already past
rds_ib_get_client_data() when the walk runs is not covered by either:
rds_ib_setup_qp() goes on to rds_ib_add_conn(), which moves the
connection onto the conn_list the walk has just finished with, and
builds a QP on a device that is on its way out.

On a hot removal the rdma_cm still catches that: its own client
removal runs after RDS's and delivers RDMA_CM_EVENT_DEVICE_REMOVAL to
the connection's id, whose drop shuts the connection down and returns
it to ib_nodev_conns.  On module unload there is no such event - the
device stays registered - and rds_destroy_pending() is already true,
so every drop short of a destroy returns early.  Nothing drops that
connection then: the device's shutdown walk is over, and the
connection never returns to ib_nodev_conns, which is the only list the
transport exit sweeps.  So it outlives the module, QP, device
reference and all.  The trigger is unloading rds_rdma while a connect
is in flight.

Make rds_ib_dev_shutdown() mark the device as shutting down under
rds_ibdev->spinlock before it walks conn_list, and have
rds_ib_add_conn() refuse, under the same lock, to attach a connection
to a device so marked.  Every connection is then either on the list
when the walk drops it, or refused: the connect fails, the connection
stays on ib_nodev_conns, and either its own drop or the exit sweep
tears it down.  rds_ib_setup_qp() has not taken anything from the
device at that point, so the failure needs no unwinding beyond the
client-data reference it already releases - but on the unload path
that release can now be the device's last: rds_ib_remove_one() has
dropped its own references by then, and the refused connect, holding
c_cm_lock, releases its reference only when the exit sweep's
rds_conn_destroy() of that connection waits for the lock, after
rds_ib_unregister_client()'s flush of rds_wq.  rds_ib_dev_free()
would then run on rds_wq with no flush left before the module text
goes away, so rds_ib_exit() flushes rds_wq once more after the sweep.

This covers the connect that attaches after rds_ib_dev_shutdown()'s
walk.  Its twin - a connection still on conn_list when the exit sweep
runs, because its shutdown work has not yet moved it back to
ib_nodev_conns - is left for the unload wait later in the series,
which re-sweeps that list until every connection is gone.

This mirrors the UEK gate on the device removal flag in
rds_ib_add_conn().
