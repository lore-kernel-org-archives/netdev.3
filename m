net/smc: bound the send length to the send buffer in smc_tx_sendmsg()

This patch clamps the local writespace snapshot in smc_tx_sendmsg() to
sndbuf_desc->len. A negative value is also treated as out of range. The
stated goal is to prevent a heap out-of-bounds write in the wrap-around
copy when the SMC-D DMB-merge path inflates conn->sndbuf_space from a
forged consumer cursor.

[Severity: Medium]
Is "the peer's wire-controlled consumer cursor" accurate for this path?

The diff_tx update in smc_cdc_msg_recv_action() only runs behind this
check:

	if (conn->lgr->is_smcd &&
	    smc_ism_support_dmb_nocopy(conn->lgr->smcd)) {

and smc_ism_support_dmb_nocopy() is:

	/* for now only loopback-ism supports
	 * merging sndbuf with peer DMB to avoid
	 * data copies between them.
	 */
	return (smcd->dibs->ops->support_mmapped_rdmb &&
		smcd->dibs->ops->support_mmapped_rdmb(smcd->dibs));

The only in-tree provider of support_mmapped_rdmb is dibs_lo_ops in
drivers/dibs/dibs_loopback.c. dibs_lo_query_rgid() accepts only its own
GID, so the peer on this path is the same kernel's SMC stack.

That kernel builds the consumer cursor from its own connection state in
smcd_cdc_msg_send():

	curs.acurs.counter = atomic64_read(&conn->local_tx_ctrl.cons.acurs);
	cdc.cons.wrap = curs.wrap;
	cdc.cons.count = curs.count;

dibs_lo_move_data() then copies it into the DMB with a bounds check.
Userspace does not write the CDC header area of the DMB.

The buffer lengths also match. smcd_new_buf_create() sets rmb_desc->len
to bufsize - sizeof(struct smcd_cdc_msg). smcd_buf_attach() sets the
attached sndbuf_desc->len to dmb_len - sizeof(struct smcd_cdc_msg). So a
conforming cursor should not produce a diff_tx larger than
sndbuf_desc->len.

Given this, is the patch hardening against a misbehaving in-kernel peer
or a future nocopy-capable device, rather than fixing a heap
out-of-bounds write that a peer can trigger? If so, could the commit
message be reworded? The current wording and the Fixes: and Cc: stable
tags describe a memory corruption that a remote peer controls.

[Severity: Medium]
Does this enforce the invariant on conn->sndbuf_space itself? Only the
local writespace snapshot is clamped. The shared atomic is never
corrected.

Later in smc_tx_sendmsg(), the subtraction still runs on the
out-of-range value:

		atomic_sub(copylen, &conn->sndbuf_space);
		/* guarantee 0 <= sndbuf_space <= sndbuf_desc->len */

A negative counter goes further negative. A value of
2 * sndbuf_desc->len stays at sndbuf_desc->len after a full-ring copy.

The source of the value is also unchanged.
smc_cdc_msg_recv_action() still adds diff_tx without a bound:

			atomic_add(diff_tx, &conn->sndbuf_space);
			/* guarantee 0 <= sndbuf_space <= sndbuf_desc->len */

smcd_cdc_msg_to_host() copies peer->cons without the wrap and count
check that smc_cdc_cursor_to_host() does for SMC-R.

If the premise in the commit message holds, the other readers would
still see the bad value:

  smc_tx_sendmsg():  if (!atomic_read(&conn->sndbuf_space) || ...
  smc_tx_wait(), smc_tx_should_cork(), smc_poll() EPOLLOUT
  smc_ioctl() SIOCOUTQ:
	answ = smc->conn.sndbuf_desc->len -
			atomic_read(&smc->conn.sndbuf_space);

The counter would never reach zero, so sendmsg would not block. It
would keep rewriting the whole ring over data the peer has not consumed
yet. SIOCOUTQ could return a negative value or one larger than the
buffer.

The commit message also says the bound is applied "at the consumer",
but this comment says "at the producer". Which one is meant?

Would it be more accurate to describe this as bounding the copy length?
Alternatively, diff_tx (or the cursor) could also be bounded where it is
received, in smc_cdc_msg_recv_action().
