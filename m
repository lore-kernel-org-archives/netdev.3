rds_rdma_cm_event_handler_cmn() picks the connection up from
cm_id->context, which carries no reference, and holds c_cm_lock - a
mutex that lives in the connection's path array - across the transport
callbacks.  Before this series that was already a use-after-free
whenever a callback destroyed the connection, since rds_conn_destroy()
freed it synchronously and the handler's mutex_unlock() ran on freed
memory; the one such callback, rds_ib_cm_connect_complete() on a
protocol version below 3.1, has meanwhile been switched to
rds_conn_drop() by commit f97d8c7bab78 ("rds: ib: use rds_conn_drop()
on protocol version mismatch"), which also removed the deadlock that
destroy took on c_cm_lock.

Now that a connection is freed by its last reference, none of the
callbacks the handler dispatches drops a reference on the connection
it was handed: the version-mismatch path only drops the connection,
and rds_ib_cm_handle_connect() puts the reference rds_conn_create()
gave it, on a connection the listener's cm_id never pointed at.  What
can reach zero while an event is in flight are the holders outside
the handler - the destroy's initial reference, a socket's cache, a
parent's c_passive, an inc.  Today the shutdown pass destroys the
cm_id, and rdma_destroy_id() waits for a running handler, before the
initial reference is dropped, so every event is ordered ahead of the
free; the pin is defensive, keeping the handler correct without
leaning on that ordering.  Take a reference for the duration of the
handler, and ignore the event if the connection is already at zero
references rather than handle it.

rds_ib_cm_initiate_connect() has the same hole on the active side: a
connection whose destroy began while its address and route were
resolving reaches RDMA_CM_EVENT_ROUTE_RESOLVED and sets up a QP -
taking a device reference in rds_ib_add_conn() - after the destroy's
shutdown pass has run, or with that pass waiting on c_cm_lock behind
the handler.  Nothing would ever release the QP, the cm_id or the
device reference, and rds_ib_exit() would wait forever for the
device.  Return before the QP is set up when the destroy is pending;
the cm_id is still ic->i_cm_id, so the shutdown destroys it.  An
unload that begins after this check has passed is covered too:
rds_ib_dev_shutdown() marks every device before the exit sweep runs,
and rds_ib_add_conn() refuses a marked device, so such a connect
fails and its connection stays on the nodev list for the sweep.

rds_ib_cm_handle_connect() has the mirror-image hole: a connection
whose destroy has already quiesced it sits in RDS_CONN_DOWN with no
cm_id, which is exactly the state the DOWN -> CONNECTING transition
claims.  A connect request arriving then would install a new cm_id and
QP on a connection that is only waiting for its last reference to go
away, and nothing would tear them down again.  Re-check
rds_destroy_pending() under c_cm_lock and reject the request instead.
