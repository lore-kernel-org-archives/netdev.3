selftests: net: test the vxlan vnifilter request limit and dump replay

This extends test_vxlan_vnifiltering.sh to cover the vnifilter request-size
limit, the 24-bit VNI range, and symmetric add/delete caps. It adds a new
vxlan_vnifilter_dump_replay() test that builds a run twice the limit,
replays the dumped ranges into a second device, and compares the two dumps.
It also adds veth-host and the test netns to cleanup().

[Severity: Low]
Can these absence checks pass without looking at the device at all?

run_cmd() does this:

	out=$(eval $cmd $stderr)
	rc=$?

That returns the status of the last command in the pipeline, which is
grep. The script does not set pipefail.

Suppose bridge vni show fails or prints nothing, for example because of a
regression in the dump path. grep -qw 20000 then exits 1 on empty input,
and log_test $? 1 reports OK.

The same pattern is used for every absence and "installed nothing" check
in vxlan_vnifilter_api(), for VNIs 20000, 30000 and 55000.

Could the dump status be checked on its own, or pipefail be enabled for
these commands?

[Severity: Low]
The commit message says:

    and the 24-bit bound exercised through END,
    not only START.

Does any case here reject a VNI because its START is out of range? START
only appears as an accepted value (vni 16777215). Both rejected cases go
out of range through END only.

The 100-4294967295 case also seems to be rejected by the request cap
whatever the policy says. In vxlan_vnifilter_check_msg():

		vnis += vni_end - vni_start + 1;
		if (vnis > VXLAN_VNI_FILTER_MSG_MAX) {

The span is far over 4096, so this returns -EINVAL whether or not the
NLA_POLICY_FULL_RANGE entries in vni_filter_entry_policy exist. So only
16777215-16777216 tests the 24-bit policy.

The case the series' "reject VNIs outside the 24-bit space" patch is
mainly about, a lone START=0xffffffff, has no test. That request has
vnis == 1, so the cap accepts it. Only the START policy then keeps
vxlan_vni_add_del() out of this endless loop:

	for (v = start_vni; v <= end_vni; v++) {

Would a case such as vni 16777216 expecting 255 be worth adding? It
covers START without risking a hang if it regresses.

[Severity: Low]
Is the exit status of the first add ever checked? The second run_cmd
overwrites $?, so log_test only sees the 14096-18191 add.

If the first add fails and the second succeeds, vxlan-src holds only
14096-18191. That is exactly 4096 VNIs, and it dumps as one entry the
input path accepts, with or without this clamp in
vxlan_vnifilter_dump_dev():

		    vnirange(vbegin, v) < VXLAN_VNI_FILTER_MSG_MAX &&

Replay then succeeds and the two dumps match, so all three dump/replay
checks report OK without testing the clamp.

This also applies when the test runs alone with
-t vxlan_vnifilter_dump_replay. In that case the API test's max-size add
check does not run first.

Could each add get its own log_test?

[Severity: Low]
Would this comparison catch a dump that drops part of the run? Both sides
come from the same vxlan_vnifilter_dump_dev(), and neither is compared
with the 10000-18191 range that was installed.

Suppose the clamp regressed so the dump stopped at the first limit
boundary and reported only 10000-14095, with no new entry starting at
14096. The replay loop would install 10000-14095 on vxlan-dst, and both
dumps would print 10000-14095.

Both the "every dumped entry is accepted on replay" and "source and
destination dump the same ranges" checks would pass, even though half
the configuration was missing from the dump.

Could src_ranges also be compared against the expected
10000-14095 14096-18191?
