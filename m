net: mana: Add support for CDX device ID 0x00C2

This adds a CDX bus transport for MANA, built as mana_cdx.ko on top of
the shared gdma_core.ko, for device ID 0x00C2. It allocates the whole MSI
pool at probe time, limits the queue count to the available vectors,
restricts DMA to 32 bits, and adds a per-bus auxiliary device name prefix
so the CDX auxiliary devices stay separate from the PCI ones.

[Severity: Medium]
Can this reset leave the whole function unusable, with no recovery short
of a manual rebind?

mana_dealloc_queues() calls it when a TX queue still has pending_sends
after the drain timeout:

mana_tx_timeout()
  -> queue_reset_work
    -> mana_per_port_queue_reset_work_handler()
      -> mana_dealloc_queues()
        -> mana_gd_dev_reset()
          -> mana_cdx_dev_reset()
            -> cdx_dev_reset()

The detach paths can reach mana_dealloc_queues() too.

drivers/cdx/controller/mc_cdx_pcol.h documents MC_CMD_CDX_DEVICE_RESET
like this:

 * After this call completes, device DMA and interrupts are quiesced, devices
 * logic is reset in a hardware-specific way and DMA bus mastering is disabled.

That resets the HWC, all EQs, the other vPorts and RDMA, but the driver
keeps treating all of them as live. There is no re-init path on CDX:

- Bus mastering is only turned on by cdx_set_master() in
  mana_cdx_gd_probe().
- MSI is only enabled in mana_cdx_setup_hwc_irqs().
- gdma_cdx_driver has no reset_prepare or reset_done callbacks.
- mana_cdx_bus_ops has no schedule_serv_work.

So would the HWC requests that follow (mana_disable_vport_rx(), vPort
object teardown, re-attach) all time out? And when
mana_gf_stats_work_handler() detects the HWC timeout, would its servicing
request just be rejected with -EOPNOTSUPP?

On PCI, the same reset through pcie_flr() is backed by HWC-timeout
recovery through mana_pci_schedule_serv_work().

CDX also still advertises stall-SQ recovery to firmware through the
common GDMA_DRV_CAP_FLAGS1:

	 GDMA_DRV_CAP_FLAG_1_HANDLE_STALL_SQ_RECOVERY | \

Without a dev_reset op, mana_gd_dev_reset() would return -EOPNOTSUPP, and
a stall in one queue would not reset the whole function.

There is a second trigger. reset_store() in drivers/cdx/cdx.c calls
cdx_dev_reset() on a bound device, and
Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-bus-cdx says the driver gets notified.
With no reset_prepare/reset_done here, wouldn't a sysfs reset leave the
device in the same state?

[Severity: Low]
Is the reason given in this comment accurate? The PCI transport does more
than spread over the local node. mana_irq_setup_numa_aware() skips SMT
siblings and puts each vector on a different physical core:

	cpumask_andnot(cpus, cpus, topology_sibling_cpumask(cpu));
	...
	irq_set_affinity_and_hint(*irqs++, topology_sibling_cpumask(cpu));

mana_irq_setup_linear() also pins vector i to CPU i.

A single-node multi-core SoC still has cores to spread over. On CDX, the
EQ interrupts keep the default affinity and get no per-queue CPU
placement.

Could the comment, and the commit message, describe this difference from
PCI accurately?

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but after this patch the comment in
mana_gd_query_max_resources() in gdma_main.c is no longer accurate:

	 * not before. Only reset on platforms that support dynamic
	 * MSI-X allocation; on non-dyn platforms msi_sharing is
	 * unconditionally true (set in mana_gd_setup_hwc_irqs).

CDX leaves msix_can_alloc_dyn NULL, so it is a non-dyn bus. Even so,
mana_cdx_setup_hwc_irqs() sets msi_sharing to false. The core may set it
back to true, and then mana_cdx_setup_remaining_irqs() forces it to false
again and overwrites max_num_queues_vport.

Should the core comment be updated? It may also help to document in the
core that a transport is expected to override msi_sharing and
max_num_queues_vport in setup_remaining_irqs.

[Severity: High]
This issue was not introduced by this patch, but the shared HWC bootstrap
path that CDX now enters here uses a doorbell index supplied by the device
without checking its bounds.

mana_hwc_init_event_handler() in hw_channel.c stores the 16-bit doorbell
directly from the EQE:

	case GDMA_EQE_HWC_INIT_EQ_ID_DB:
		eq_db.as_uint32 = event->details[0];
		hwc->cq->gdma_eq->id = eq_db.eq_id;
		gd->doorbell = eq_db.doorbell;

mana_hwc_establish_channel() checks cq->id against max_num_cqs, but it
never checks the doorbell. mana_gd_ring_doorbell() then computes the MMIO
address:

	void __iomem *addr = gc->db_page_base + gc->db_page_size * db_index;

db_page_size is at least 4KB and the doorbell can be as large as 0xFFFF.
Could the next mana_gd_ring_eq() or mana_gd_ring_cq() then write far past
the ioremapped BAR0, into unmapped vmalloc space or another mapping?

mana_gd_register_device() already has this check for the regular
doorbell:

	if (gc->db_page_off + gc->db_page_size * ((u64)resp.db_id + 1) > gc->bar0_size) {

Should the HWC path apply the same check? This affects the PCI transport
as well.
