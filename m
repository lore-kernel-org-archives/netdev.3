net/rds: pin the connection across RDMA-CM event handling

This patch makes rds_rdma_cm_event_handler_cmn() take a reference on the
connection for the duration of each RDMA-CM event. It also adds
rds_destroy_pending() checks to rds_ib_cm_initiate_connect() and
rds_ib_cm_handle_connect(), so a connection that is being destroyed does
not get a new QP or cm_id set up.

[Severity: Medium]
Can the leak described in this comment and in the commit message actually
happen? The commit message says:

  "a connection whose destroy began while its address and route were
  resolving reaches RDMA_CM_EVENT_ROUTE_RESOLVED and sets up a QP -
  taking a device reference in rds_ib_add_conn() - after the destroy's
  shutdown pass has run, or with that pass waiting on c_cm_lock behind
  the handler.  Nothing would ever release the QP, the cm_id or the
  device reference, and rds_ib_exit() would wait forever for the
  device."

First, the case where the shutdown pass is waiting on c_cm_lock. The
quiesce calls rds_conn_path_drop(cp, true), which sets RDS_CONN_ERROR and
queues cp_down_w. Nothing in the ROUTE_RESOLVED path moves the state away
from ERROR.

Once the handler releases c_cm_lock, rds_conn_shutdown() moves ERROR to
DISCONNECTING and calls rds_ib_conn_path_shutdown(). Because ic->i_cm_id
is set, that function already tears everything down:

rds_ib_conn_path_shutdown() {
    ...
		rdma_destroy_id(ic->i_cm_id);
    ...
		if (ic->rds_ibdev)
			rds_ib_remove_conn(ic->rds_ibdev, conn);

		ic->i_cm_id = NULL;
    ...
}

So the QP, CQs, cm_id and device reference are all released, with or
without this patch.

Second, the case where the shutdown pass has already run. By then
ic->i_cm_id has been destroyed and cleared, and rdma_destroy_id() waits
for a running handler and blocks later callbacks on that id.

A ROUTE_RESOLVED event on some other id fails the ibic->i_cm_id == cm_id
test in rds_rdma_cm_event_handler_cmn() and only calls rds_conn_drop().
While the pass is running, the handler exits early on
RDS_CONN_DISCONNECTING. A conn that is unhashed and destroy-pending can't
be reconnected either.

Third, the device reference. IB conns are only destroyed from
rds_ib_destroy_nodev_conns(), which rds_ib_exit() calls after
rds_ib_unregister_client(). By that point rds_ib_dev_shutdown() has set
shutting_down on every device, and rds_ib_add_conn() bails out before it
takes the reference:

rds_ib_add_conn() {
    ...
	if (rds_ibdev->shutting_down) {
		ret = -ENODEV;
    ...
}

As far as I can tell, the new early return only fires when
rds_destroy_pending() is true through t_unloading (rds_ib_is_unloading())
before any destroy has started. Neither the comment nor the commit
message mentions that case, and the exit sweep would tear such a conn
down anyway.

Also, suppose the "already quiesced" case could be reached. Would
returning 0 here help? It would leave a cm_id whose context points at a
conn that is about to be freed, and rds_ib_conn_free() never destroys
ic->i_cm_id.

The check in rds_ib_cm_handle_connect() has the same problem. The commit
message calls it "the mirror-image hole", but rds_rdma_exit() stops the
listeners before rds_ib_exit() runs:

rds_rdma_exit() {
	rds_rdma_listen_stop();
	rds_ib_exit();
}

So the listeners are destroyed before the unloading flag is set or any
IB conn is destroyed. In addition, the lookup in rds_conn_create() can't
return a conn once rds_conn_destroy() has unhashed it under
rds_conn_lock.

Both checks look harmless. Could the commit message and these two
comments describe them as defensive, the way the handler pin is
described? Right now they read as fixes for a reachable QP/cm_id/device
reference leak and an rds_ib_exit() hang.
