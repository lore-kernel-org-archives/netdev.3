net/iucv: do not count the SHT frame against the receive window

This patch stops iucv_sock_recvmsg() from counting zero-length HiperSockets
frames, such as the SHT, in msg_recv. It also drops the WARN_ON(1) on the
over-window close. The window update is now sent only while sk_state is
IUCV_CONNECTED, so no update goes out through the hs_dev that
iucv_sock_close() cleared.

Closes: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/179183431327.434549.446348148837850426@kernel.org/

[Severity: Low]
This is a pre-existing issue, but the sender side has the opposite
mismatch. iucv_sock_sendmsg() increments msg_sent for a zero-length send
as well:

    atomic_inc(&iucv->msg_sent);
    err = afiucv_hs_send(&txmsg, sk, skb, 0);

If the sender has receive credit pending (msg_recv > 0), afiucv_hs_send()
sets AF_IUCV_FLAG_WIN on that frame. afiucv_hs_rcv() then consumes it as
a credit only:

    case (AF_IUCV_FLAG_WIN):
        err = afiucv_hs_callback_win(sk, skb);
        if (skb->len == sizeof(struct af_iucv_trans_hdr)) {
            consume_skb(skb);
            break;
        }

The frame never reaches recvmsg(), so the receiver never counts it and
never credits it back.

Does the sender lose one slot of msglimit_peer on each such send? If so,
iucv_below_msglim() eventually stays false and its own sendmsg() blocks.

Only the local sender's socket is affected. The v2 notes already say
that this frame "is a window update to afiucv_hs_rcv() and never reaches
recvmsg()", and this patch does not touch that path.

>  			}

[Severity: High]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but the new comment says a
peer reaches this from the network. Is the window enforced anywhere on
the receive side before this read-time check?

Once the receive queue is full, afiucv_hs_callback_rx() appends to
backlog_skb_q with no length or memory limit:

    if (skb_queue_empty(&iucv->backlog_skb_q)) {
        if (__sock_queue_rcv_skb(sk, skb))
            /* handle rcv queue full */
            skb_queue_tail(&iucv->backlog_skb_q, skb);
    } else
        skb_queue_tail(&iucv_sk(sk)->backlog_skb_q, skb);

The backlog skbs are not charged to sk_rmem_alloc. msglimit is checked
only here, when the local application reads, and backlog_skb_q is only
purged by the close that follows.

Can a connected peer that ignores its window keep growing backlog_skb_q
while the application is not reading, until the system runs out of
memory?

The commit message leaves a per-socket backlog budget to the separate
socket-locking rework.

[Severity: Medium]
This is also a pre-existing issue. This check uses the current
iucv->msglimit, but the peer enforces the window it got in the SYN:

afiucv_hs_send():
    if (flags == AF_IUCV_FLAG_SYN)
        phs_hdr->window = iucv->msglimit;

afiucv_hs_callback_syn():
    niucv->msglimit_peer = trans_hdr->window;

iucv_sock_setsockopt(SO_MSGLIMIT) accepts IUCV_BOUND. A connecting socket
stays in that state until the SYN|ACK arrives, so msglimit can be lowered
after the SYN has gone out.

Can a peer that stays within its granted window then push msg_recv past
the lowered msglimit while frames wait in backlog_skb_q? That would close
the socket with -EFAULT.

Removing the WARN makes this less severe. The commit message says the
rework "keeps the advertised window in a field of its own for that".

[Severity: Medium]
Is this state check serialized against the over-window close?

iucv_sock_recvmsg() never takes lock_sock(), and message_q.lock is
dropped just above. __iucv_sock_close() runs under lock_sock_nested()
from iucv_sock_close(). After the state changes, it clears hs_dev:

    WRITE_ONCE(iucv->hs_dev, NULL);
    WRITE_ONCE(sk->sk_bound_dev_if, 0);
    dev_put(dev);

Consider two threads reading the same HiperSockets socket while msg_recv
goes over msglimit (a peer sending past its window, or a lowered
SO_MSGLIMIT):

reader A                            reader B
iucv_sock_recvmsg()
  send_win = true
  sk->sk_state == IUCV_CONNECTED
                                    iucv_sock_recvmsg()
                                      msg_recv > msglimit
                                      iucv_sock_close()
                                        __iucv_sock_close()
                                          hs_dev = NULL
  iucv_send_ctrl()
    LL_RESERVED_SPACE(iucv->hs_dev)

Wouldn't reader A still dereference a NULL hs_dev in iucv_send_ctrl()?
Then afiucv_hs_send() returns -ENODEV, and recvmsg() moves the CLOSED
socket back to IUCV_DISCONN.

The NULL check in afiucv_hs_send() reloads hs_dev. It also runs only
after LL_RESERVED_SPACE() has already dereferenced the pointer.

If A loads hs_dev just before B clears it, A also keeps using the
net_device after B's dev_put(), without holding a reference.

The same race existed before this patch, when the call was
unconditional. Here, sk_state is also read with a plain load.

Would taking lock_sock(sk) around the state test and iucv_send_ctrl()
close this? message_q.lock is already released at this point, and
__iucv_sock_close() already calls iucv_send_ctrl() under lock_sock.
