You don't hold a lock that prevents new VMAs appearing/disappearing
spontaneously at the point you call lock_vma_under_rcu(), or after you drop the
mmap read lock, only that at the point of checking a VMA spans address, so
there's nothing preventing a VMA suddenly appearing after you check right? Or it
not being the one you wanted?

And checking to see if it's 'really the one you meant' is itself fraught (see
the whole uffd saga on that).

Point I'm making is that in any case where you'd actually care you'd need to
take a stronger lock anyway, so it's actually potentially dangerous to
differentiate between the two.

Given the overflow is very very unlikely I think it's also not a big deal to not
differentiate anyway.

Agree this is worth spelling out in the comment (I raised similarly).

Maybe something like:

	If a VMA exists which spans @address, return that VMA, read-locked.

	If no VMA is mapped there or, very unlikely, a reference count overflow
	occurred, return NULL.

	Nothing prevents VMAs being unmapped/mapped before or after the VMA is
	looked up, if a stronger guarantee is required, take an mmap lock.
