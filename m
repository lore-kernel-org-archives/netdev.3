net/smc: do not credit bytes that splice() did not take

The patch adds a short-count path to the chunk loop in smc_rx_recvmsg()
so that only the number of bytes splice_to_pipe() actually accepted is
credited to copylen, read_remaining and read_done.  It also adds a
zero-count path that returns -EAGAIN when nothing was taken.

>     A pipe that is not empty is enough to hit this; SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK on a
>     full pipe produces the zero case.

[Severity: Low]
Is "A pipe that is not empty is enough to hit this" accurate?  A non-zero
short return from splice_to_pipe() requires smc_rx_splice() to submit more
than one page:

net/smc/smc_rx.c:smc_rx_splice() {
	nr_pages = !lgr->is_smcd && smc->conn.rmb_desc->is_vm ?
		   PAGE_ALIGN(len + offset) / PAGE_SIZE : 1;

For SMC-D and for SMC-R with physically contiguous RMBs nr_pages is 1 and
the single pipe_buffer carries partial[0].len == len, so the transfer is
all-or-nothing.  Together with wait_for_space() in splice_file_to_pipe()
guaranteeing at least one free slot on entry, doesn't the short-count case
only occur for SMC-R with is_vm RMBs?

Would it help to name that configuration in the changelog so backporters
know what to test?

[Severity: High]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but since the patch reworks
exactly this accounting: does this pre-existing exit leak bytes_to_rcv on
a wrapped read?

For a read that wraps the ring, chunk 0 can succeed and chunk 1 fail.
smc_rx_splice() has already committed chunk 0:

net/smc/smc_rx.c:smc_rx_splice() {
	bytes = splice_to_pipe(pipe, &spd);
	if (bytes > 0)
		atomic_add(bytes, &smc->conn.splice_pending);

and the queued buffers advance the consumer cursor when the reader drains
them:

net/smc/smc_rx.c:smc_rx_pipe_buf_release() {
	lock_sock(sk);
	smc_rx_update_cons(smc, priv->len);
	release_sock(sk);

Chunk 1 then finds the pipe full.  fs/splice.c:splice_to_pipe() converts
no progress to an error rather than 0:

	if (!ret)
		ret = -EAGAIN;

so control takes the quoted "if (rc < 0) ... goto out" with read_done ==
chunk 0 length, jumping past the only debit site in smc_rx_recvmsg():

	atomic_sub(copylen, &conn->bytes_to_rcv);

Doesn't that leave cons advanced by the delivered bytes while
bytes_to_rcv still counts them?  smc_rx_data_available() reads
atomic_read(&conn->bytes_to_rcv) - peeked, so would a subsequent
recvmsg()/splice() start at the advanced cursor and copy that many bytes
of stale RMB content from past the producer position?

Also, can the documented invariant "0 <= bytes_to_rcv <= rmb_desc->len"
be violated if this repeats?

> +				if (!msg && rc < chunk_len) {

[Severity: Medium]
Can rc ever be 0 here?  splice_to_pipe() returns 0 only for
spd->nr_pages == 0, and otherwise ends with:

fs/splice.c:splice_to_pipe() {
	if (!ret)
		ret = -EAGAIN;

smc_rx_splice() always builds nr_pages >= 1 and returns the
splice_to_pipe() value unchanged, so the "took nothing" case arrives as
-EAGAIN and is consumed by the pre-existing block above, which reports
-EFAULT to userspace.  Does that make this "if (!rc)" arm unreachable,
and the changelog claim

     When it took nothing, return -EAGAIN instead of reporting a length
     that was not delivered.

not take effect?

On the same note, does "SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK on a full pipe produces the
zero case" hold?  splice_file_to_pipe() calls wait_for_space() before
do_splice_read():

fs/splice.c:wait_for_space() {
		if (!pipe_is_full(pipe))
			return 0;
		if (flags & SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK)
			return -EAGAIN;

so a completely full pipe fails before smc_splice_read() is entered.
Should the comment block above also be reworded, since it describes a
callee returning zero that splice_to_pipe() does not do?

> +					copylen = chunk_len_sum - chunk_len + rc;
> +					read_remaining -= rc;
> +					read_done += rc;
> +					break;
> +				}
>  			}
>  			read_remaining -= chunk_len;
>  			read_done += chunk_len;

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue outside the diff, but this patch depends on
the invariant it breaks, so it may be worth mentioning: in
smc_rx_pipe_buf_release() the cursor advance happens under the socket
lock while the splice_pending decrement happens after it is dropped:

net/smc/smc_rx.c:smc_rx_pipe_buf_release() {
	lock_sock(sk);
	smc_rx_update_cons(smc, priv->len);
	release_sock(sk);
	if (atomic_sub_and_test(priv->len, &conn->splice_pending))
		smc_rx_wake_up(sk);

smc_rx_recvmsg() assumes cons plus splice_pending marks the start of
unread data:

	splbytes = atomic_read(&conn->splice_pending);
	...
	smc_curs_copy(&cons, &conn->local_tx_ctrl.cons, conn);
	...
	if (splbytes)
		smc_curs_add(conn->rmb_desc->len, &cons, splbytes);

In the window between release_sock() and atomic_sub_and_test(), cons
already includes priv->len and splice_pending still counts the same
bytes.  Can a concurrent splice on the same socket then start priv->len
bytes too far, skipping unread data and handing stale ring content to the
pipe?

The recvmsg() path looks protected because it waits while splice_pending
is non-zero:

		if (!readable || (msg && splbytes)) {

but the splice path (msg == NULL) is not gated on splice_pending.  The
pipe mutex doesn't serialize this either, since splice_file_to_pipe()
holds only the destination pipe's lock, so draining pipe A can race with
splicing the same socket into pipe B.

Would moving the atomic_sub_and_test() before release_sock() make cons
and splice_pending change together with respect to the socket lock?
