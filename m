Thank you, this is exactly what I was asking about - my background isn't
crypto and ultimately whatever direction is implemented will depend on
$vendor and I'll just be following along, but I'll read up on this.

"Inline crypto engine" seems to be a qualcomm marketing term, but from
looking at their doc the API seems to be PKCS#11 smart card?
Having worked on these for some other hardware I can't say I find it
easier to use than af alg, but it's definitely something that can be
worked out.

"The CPU case" (looking at the RISC-V High Assurance Cryptography) would
be some CPU instructions (ISA) reserved for crypto ops?
That's interesting, I had never seen this but I can see this would
likely provide the best performance.. And if the ISA gain enough
traction having them supported out of the box by OpenSSL or whatsnot
might actually be possible, that'd be a great step forward.

Right, sorry for asking about an out-of-tree driver, I hadn't realized
since caam itself has been upstream for a while.

I was just curious about the double-take approach taken with these two patches:
 crypto: af_alg - Drop support for off-CPU cryptography (this)
 crypto: af_alg - Add af_alg_restrict sysctl, defaulting to 1 ([4])
[4] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-crypto/20260622234803.6982-1-ebiggers@kernel.org/T/#u

I assume part of it was just that the whitelist wasn't ready yet when
this patch was merged, but as far as I understand if the whitelist
sysctl is implemented this is basically noop?
(Well, I guess it'll allow code simplification over time, but these
hopefully won't be backported to stable kernels too aggressively.. While
I fully expect to see this "Drop support for off-CPU crypto" patch to
show up in a couple of weeks in older stable trees; and for practical
purposes I don't see much way around just reverting it for now)

Thanks for putting up with me.

Right, the program I rely on actually uses a /dev/caam-keygen device
from another NXP non-upstreamed patch, but you are correct that there is
driver specific glue already.

So this is basically what Demi Marie suggested as well, and I'm sure we
can come up with driver specific APIs that are simpler than af alg,
but these are actually a pain to support for me (in my position of
"device integrator" building OS blocks for a variety of platforms)

I'm also "supporting" SE050 and ATECC608A out of chip "secure elements",
as well as looking at i.MX in-chip "edgelock secure enclave" as well as
the caam algorithm I was talking about here, and they all require some
sort of middleware that's far from trivial to configure and get to play
nice together
(if someone's curious, these three:
 https://github.com/NXP/plug-and-trust
 https://github.com/microchiptech/cryptoauthlib
 https://github.com/nxp-imx/imx-secure-enclave
)

So being selfish I'd very much appreciate some effort to have a standard
API everyone could use to simplify my userspace, but given vendors will
never spend this kind of time I guess it's a pipe dream and I'll be
stuck with custom drivers and/or framework for the forseeable future...
But it's not like complaining about this to either of you is any help,
I'm grateful you took the time to answer so far.


Thanks,
