OK!

OK but for this use case it's not dramatic (it could be more annyoing
for the cache where I'd like this zero-copy from memory to the wire
though).

In this one it's indeed a 16kB block that is repeated into the
same pipe by simplicity, in its ancestor it was 64kB. We try to
make as large a pipe as we can, but that's all.

No no, it's definitely not doing that (or it's a bug, but it's not
supposed to happen). I'm perfectly aware that one must definitely not
do that, and it's a guarantee the user of vmsplice() must provide.

We agree that this would deliver complete garbage an I'm not interested
in such a "feature" at all.

I must confess I never knew how it deals with pages shared over a
fork(), and have been wondering if two processes could create a
shared memory area on the fly just by using vmsplice() on each side
and end up with the same pages (I don't need this but it could have
very nice use cases).

No no don't worry, I'm not seeing any value in changing data after
vmsplice() and that would just be a bug. My goal here is only to
pre-fill a buffer with a pattern then prepare the pipe with that
pattern, nothing less, nothing more.

I think so, but I wouldn't be the one blaming you for this ;-)

Thanks for the clarifications!
