Hi,

Thanks for the review. Since this patch is too long. I will reply the comments
in the summary part.

In patch v1, sashiko suggested to take the SKIP/XFAIL arms when "expected"
itself is ksft_skip/ksft_xfail? Which would looks like

  log_test $rc ksft_xfail.

But ksft_xfail is 2. I'm afraid some test may expect rc=2 and should report
PASS. So I dropped both skip/xfail arms in the function.

Adding a specific handler for fib_nexthops.sh specific seem a little over.
I'd prefer to drop the fib_nexthops.sh change since this is the only
test that covers ksft_xfail in log_test.

Ack, I will init ret in case some test not using it.

sashiko suggested to add a changelog. I will drop the fib_nexthops.sh
changes, so no need to bother.

Ack, the fib_nexthops.sh change will be dropped to avoid this.

Ack, I will use ret=1 directly.

Not update in this patch.

Ack, I will add this on my todo list and fix it separately.

Thanks
