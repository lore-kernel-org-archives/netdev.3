ibmveth: Refactor RX interrupt control for MQ RX queues

This commit adds queue-indexed RX interrupt helpers to ibmveth and wires
them into open, close, poll, the IRQ handler and the process-context RX
kick sites. It also adds opened and rx_irq_setup flags so that a close
after a failed reopen doesn't repeat napi_disable() and free_irq().
Runtime stays single queue.

> Opened / rx_irq_setup also closes a pre-existing hang: after a
> failed reopen, a later ndo_stop used to napi_disable and free_irq
> a second time (rtnl spin + already-free IRQ). That depends on the
> helpers in this patch, so there is no standalone Fixes: tag.

[Severity: Medium]
Is the "depends on the helpers" part accurate? The hang fix appears to
be only the opened flag:

ibmveth_close()
	if (!adapter->opened)
		return 0;

ibmveth_open()
	adapter->opened = true;   /* success path only */

Neither of these uses the new IRQ helpers, and the same bool would
apply to the parent tree unchanged.

In the parent tree, every ibmveth_open() failure ends at the out: label
with napi_disable(), and ibmveth_close() also starts with napi_disable().
ibmveth_change_mtu(), ibmveth_set_csum_offload(), ibmveth_set_tso() and
veth_pool_store() call ibmveth_close()/ibmveth_open() directly. When the
reopen fails, IFF_UP stays set.

The next ndo_stop (ifdown, or unregister_netdev() from ibmveth_remove())
then calls napi_disable() on a NAPI that is already disabled. It spins
under RTNL, and would then free_irq() an IRQ that was already freed.

Could the opened gate go into a small standalone patch ahead of the
series, with something like:

Fixes: 88426f2acae0 ("ibmveth: Cleanup error handling inside ibmveth_open")
Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org

so stable kernels get the hang fix?

[Severity: Low]
These parts of the message describe code that isn't in this commit.

There is no poll_stopping() helper yet. At this commit, ibmveth_poll()
calls ibmveth_enable_irq(adapter, 0) unconditionally after
napi_complete_done(). The guard only arrives with the later "ibmveth:
Harden RX poll path with helpers".

The first paragraph says enable_irq can still run after free_irq. It
then says free_irq before free_lan is intentional once PHYP delivery is
masked. At this commit, don't those two statements contradict each
other?

The while (--i) rollback loop isn't in the parent tree. It looks like
it came from an earlier revision of this patch.

The MQ enable-fail rollback also can't run at this commit. Probe sets
multi_queue = 0 and num_rx_queues = IBMVETH_DEFAULT_RX_QUEUES, and
IBMVETH_MAX_RX_QUEUES is 1U.

Series-relative labels such as P09 also lose their meaning once the
patch is applied.

Could the version history and series-relative notes move below the ---
line or into the cover letter? The body could then state plainly that
the re-arm window after free_irq stays open until "ibmveth: Harden RX
poll path with helpers".

[Severity: Medium]
Is the second mask here actually ordered after the tail of an in-flight
ibmveth_poll()?

napi_disable() returns as soon as it can claim NAPI_STATE_SCHED. That
happens right after the poll's napi_complete_done(), not when the poll
returns. The poll then continues:

ibmveth_poll()
	if (!napi_complete_done(napi, frames_processed))
		goto out;
	...
	rc = ibmveth_enable_irq(adapter, 0);  /* H_VIO_SIGNAL enable */
	...
	napi_schedule(napi)                   /* fails, DISABLE is set */

At this commit there is no teardown check in that path. The re-arm can
land after the second ibmveth_disable_irq() above and after free_irq().
Queue 0 would then stay unmasked in PHYP with no Linux handler until
h_free_logical_lan().

The only wait for the poll tail is the synchronize_net() in
ibmveth_close(), and it runs after free_irq(). The parent tree called
h_free_logical_lan() before free_irq(), so it never had a window with
PHYP live and no handler installed.

The kernel-doc ("Remask after napi_disable() in case an in-flight poll
re-armed PHYP ... free_irq() runs only after that") assumes this
ordering. The err_disable_napi rollback in
ibmveth_setup_rx_interrupts() uses the same pattern.

Later in the series, "ibmveth: Harden RX poll path with helpers" adds an
ibmveth_poll_stopping() check after napi_complete_done(). That covers
dev_close(), where netif_running() is already false.

It doesn't cover the direct ibmveth_close() callers
(ibmveth_change_mtu(), veth_pool_store(), ibmveth_set_csum_offload(),
ibmveth_set_tso()), where netif_running() is still true.

Would it close the window to wait for the poll tail (for example with
synchronize_net()) before the second mask and synchronize_irq(), and
only then call free_irq()?

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, not one introduced by this patch. This
is the ibmveth_alloc_buffer_pools() failure path, which runs after a
successful ibmveth_register_logical_lan(). Does it leave the logical
LAN registered with PHYP?

out_free_tx_ltb never calls h_free_logical_lan():

out_free_tx_ltb:
	while (--i >= 0)
		ibmveth_free_tx_ltb(adapter, i);
	ibmveth_cleanup_rx_resources(adapter);

So the buffer list, RX queue and filter list are unmapped and freed
while PHYP may still hold the registration.

With the new opened gate, no later ndo_stop reaches h_free_logical_lan()
either. In the parent tree, the later close hung in the second
napi_disable() before getting that far.

This looks fixed later in the series by "ibmveth: Add RX queue register
helpers for MQ", which moves ibmveth_alloc_buffer_pools() ahead of
ibmveth_register_rx_queues().

[Severity: Medium]
Can this early return leak TX LTBs allocated by ibmveth_set_channels()?

After a failed internal reopen, IFF_UP stays set but opened is false.
ibmveth_set_channels() only checks IFF_UP:

ibmveth_set_channels() {
	if (!(netdev->flags & IFF_UP))
		return netif_set_real_num_tx_queues(netdev, goal);
	...
	for (i = old; i < goal; i++) {
		if (adapter->tx_ltb_ptr[i])
			continue;

		rc = ibmveth_allocate_tx_ltb(adapter, i);
	...
}

So ethtool -L in that state allocates new LTBs. ibmveth_close() then
returns here and skips the ibmveth_free_tx_ltb() loop. The next
ibmveth_open() overwrites tx_ltb_ptr[]/tx_ltb_dma[], which leaks the
buffer and its DMA mapping.

Before this patch the same sequence hung in the second napi_disable(),
so the gate trades the hang for a leak.

Later in the series this goes away: ibmveth_set_channels() checks
!adapter->opened and then only calls netif_set_real_num_tx_queues(),
without allocating LTBs. Could that check go into this patch alongside
the gate?

[Severity: Low]
Does moving ibmveth_update_rx_no_buffer() ahead of h_free_logical_lan()
drop counts from rx_no_buffer?

While the logical LAN is still registered, PHYP keeps consuming posted
buffers. Once they run out, it keeps incrementing the no-buffer counter
in the last 8 bytes of buffer_list_addr[0]. NAPI is already disabled at
this point, so nothing replenishes the buffers.

Any increments between this read and H_FREE_LOGICAL_LAN never reach
adapter->rx_no_buffer, which is the value kept across close.

The commit message says "Close harvests the PHYP no-buffer count before
h_free so the read still hits a live buffer-list page". In either
order, though, buffer_list_addr[0] is only unmapped and freed later, in
ibmveth_cleanup_rx_resources().

Wouldn't reading after h_free_logical_lan(), as the old code did, be
just as safe and give the final value?

The same order is still there at the end of the series: the final
ibmveth_close() reads the counter under replenish_lock and then calls
ibmveth_free_all_queues().

[Severity: High]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but can this schedule_work()
race with ibmveth_remove()?

ibmveth_remove() {
	...
	cancel_work_sync(&adapter->work);
	...
	unregister_netdev(netdev);

	free_netdev(netdev);
	...
}

NAPI poll stays live until unregister_netdev() closes the device. If
ibmveth_enable_irq() fails in that window, adapter->work can be queued
again after cancel_work_sync(). free_netdev() then frees the embedded
work_struct while it may still be queued.

The parent tree has the same order. "ibmveth: Enable multi-queue RX
receive path" later reorders ibmveth_remove() so that unregister_netdev()
runs before cancel_work_sync().
