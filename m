How are you populating the list of recipients for your e-mail?

You are including folks no longer involved in kernel development, but more
importantly, you are using an obsolete e-mail address for the MHI maintainer
(Mani). I've replaced his address in my reply.

Please make sure to use scripts/get_maintainer.pl to get an accurate list of
recipients.
