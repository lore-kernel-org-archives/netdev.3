net/sched: sch_fq_pie: add per-flow statistics via class ops

This adds a Qdisc_class_ops table to sch_fq_pie with walk, dump and
dump_stats so that per-flow PIE state can be read with 'tc -s class show'.
It extends tc_fq_pie_xstats with a type discriminator plus an embedded
tc_fq_pie_cl_stats, growing the structure from 36 to 64 bytes.

A few questions below.

First, about the last paragraph of the changelog:

    Derive delay with div_u64() from the full 64-bit nanosecond value rather
    than truncating to u32 before dividing, which wrapped for sojourn times
    above ~4.295 s, and widen avg_dq_rate to u64 before scaling it by
    PSCHED_TICKS_PER_SEC.

[Severity: Medium]
Is this paragraph describing a change made by this patch?  The diff is
purely additive and net/sched/sch_fq_pie.c had no delay or avg_dq_rate
conversion before it, so the new fq_pie_dump_class_stats() is not replacing
any truncating computation.

The code that actually contains both of the described defects is
pie_dump_stats() in net/sched/sch_pie.c, which this patch does not touch and
does not mention, and there is no Fixes: tag:

net/sched/sch_pie.c:pie_dump_stats() {
	...
	.delay		= ((u32)PSCHED_TICKS2NS(READ_ONCE(q->vars.qdelay))) /
			   NSEC_PER_USEC,
	...
	if (st.dq_rate_estimating)
		st.avg_dq_rate = READ_ONCE(q->vars.avg_dq_rate) *
				 (PSCHED_TICKS_PER_SEC) >> PIE_SCALE;
	...
}

Could the paragraph either be reworded as a deliberate difference from the
pie qdisc, or the series extended to fix pie_dump_stats() as well?  The
later patch in the series that re-documents tc_pie_xstats.delay as
microseconds leaves the wrapping conversion in place.

[Severity: Low]
Since this is a new ABI field, is __u32 wide enough for avg_dq_rate?
fq_pie_dump_class_stats() computes the value in u64 and then stores it into
this 32-bit member with no saturation:

	xstats.class_stats.avg_dq_rate =
		((u64)READ_ONCE(flow->vars.avg_dq_rate)
		* PSCHED_TICKS_PER_SEC) >> PIE_SCALE;

With PSCHED_TICKS_PER_SEC == 15625000 and PIE_SCALE == 8 the internal
estimator value is scaled by 61035.15625, so a per-flow rate above
U32_MAX bytes/second (about 34.36 Gbit/s) wraps: an internal avg_dq_rate of
81920 (5,000,000,000 B/s) is reported as 705,032,704.

Widening the member to __u64 or clamping with min_t() is still possible
before the layout is frozen.  It does mirror the existing
tc_pie_xstats.avg_dq_rate width, so if matching that is intentional it
would be worth saying so.

[Severity: Low]
Can the class id for the last flow collide with the qdisc handle when
flows_cnt is at its maximum?  fq_pie_change() accepts 65536 flows:

net/sched/sch_fq_pie.c:fq_pie_change() {
	...
	if (!q->flows_cnt || q->flows_cnt > 65536) {
		NL_SET_ERR_MSG_MOD(extack,
				   "Number of flows must range in [1..65536]");
	...
}

and fq_pie_walk() numbers classes one-based with tc_qdisc_stats_dump(sch,
i + 1, arg), so the last bucket arrives here as cl == 0x10000.  TC_H_MIN
masks with 0xffff, so minor becomes 0 and the RTM_NEWTCLASS message keeps
the tcm_handle that tc_fill_tclass() already set from the qdisc, i.e. X:0.

That handle cannot be used to address the flow afterwards: fq_pie_find()
always returns 0 and fq_pie_classify() only honours minors in
[1, flows_cnt]:

	if (TC_H_MAJ(skb->priority) == sch->handle &&
	    TC_H_MIN(skb->priority) > 0 &&
	    TC_H_MIN(skb->priority) <= q->flows_cnt)

The same encoding exists in net/sched/sch_fq_codel.c with the same 65536
limit, so this is a faithful copy of existing behaviour, but capping the
emitted ids at 65535 would avoid it here.

[Severity: Low]
Can this shift discard the high bits of prob?  pie_calculate_probability()
in net/sched/sch_pie.c does not clamp vars->prob to MAX_PROB
(U64_MAX >> 8) on the increase path; its only guard is the full u64 wrap:

net/sched/sch_pie.c:pie_calculate_probability() {
	...
	WRITE_ONCE(vars->prob, vars->prob + delta);

	if (delta > 0) {
		/* prevent overflow */
		if (vars->prob < oldprob) {
			WRITE_ONCE(vars->prob, MAX_PROB);
	...
}

Sustained congestion can add up to roughly 4% of MAX_PROB per tupdate
(the 2% cap plus MAX_PROB/50 when qdelay exceeds 250 ms), so vars.prob can
grow past MAX_PROB.  The shift by 8 then drops the top bits and a flow that
pie_drop_early() is dropping unconditionally is reported with a near-zero
probability.

Would min_t(u64, READ_ONCE(flow->vars.prob), MAX_PROB) before scaling be
reasonable?  The same expression already exists in pie_dump_stats(), so
fixing both would keep them consistent.

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but a note for anyone reading the sampling here: the
64-bit flow->vars.prob and flow->vars.qdelay are read without the qdisc
lock, since tc_fill_tclass() passes NULL as the lock to
gnet_stats_start_copy_compat(), so the snapshot is not internally
consistent and can tear on 32-bit kernels.

That matches the direction set by commit 5154561d9b119f ("net/sched:
sch_pie: annotate data-races in pie_dump_stats()") and commit
6d4106e8df94c0, and fq_codel_dump_class_stats() samples flow->cvars.* and
flow->deficit the same way, so no change seems needed.

[Severity: Low]
This is a pre-existing gap and is not introduced by this patch, but since
the new ops table is the natural place to address it: sch_fq_pie.c still
allocates a block in fq_pie_init() with
tcf_block_get(&q->block, &q->filter_list, sch, extack) and classifies every
packet through q->filter_list in fq_pie_classify(), yet no filter can ever
be attached.

net/sched/cls_api.c:__tcf_qdisc_find() {
	...
	if (!cops->tcf_block) {
		NL_SET_ERR_MSG(extack, "Class doesn't support blocks");
		err = -EOPNOTSUPP;
		goto errout_qdisc;
	}
	...
}

So rcu_dereference_bh(q->filter_list) in fq_pie_classify() is always NULL
and the "optional external classifier" path stays dead code.  Would it make
sense to either wire up a root-only .tcf_block plus .bind_tcf/.unbind_tcf
the way fq_codel_class_ops does, or drop the unused block and filter_list?

[Severity: Medium]
Growing struct tc_fq_pie_xstats from 36 to 64 bytes is visible to
userspace in both directions, and the changelog only argues the one
direction - that the nine existing __u32 counters keep their offsets, so
an old tc still parses a new kernel's payload.  The other direction is a
new tc on an old kernel: iproute2's fq_pie_print_xstats() rejects the
attribute outright if RTA_PAYLOAD(xstats) is smaller than
sizeof(struct tc_fq_pie_xstats), so a tc rebuilt against this header
(sizeof == 64) silently stops printing anything for 'tc -s qdisc show
dev ... fq_pie' on every kernel that still emits the 36-byte payload
from fq_pie_dump_stats().

That is not a kernel regression as such, but it does mean a distro tc
update loses fq_pie statistics on older kernels, so it would be good to
have it spelled out.  Does the accompanying iproute2 change parse
defensively, e.g. copying min(RTA_PAYLOAD(xstats), sizeof(st)) bytes
into a zeroed local struct rather than bailing out?  The enum values
help here: TCA_FQ_PIE_XSTATS_QDISC is 0, so a short read that is
zero-filled still resolves to the qdisc variant, and a length-tolerant
parse needs no extra magic.  Could that reasoning be added to the
changelog?

The alternative would be to leave tc_fq_pie_xstats at 36 bytes
entirely and emit a separate struct (just tc_fq_pie_cl_stats, with its
own discriminator if one is needed) from fq_pie_dump_class_stats(), so
the qdisc path's payload length never changes.  fq_codel could put the
type first and union the two variants in tc_fq_codel_xstats because the
discriminator was there from day one; fq_pie cannot do that without
moving offsets, which is exactly why appending here perturbs the qdisc
path as well.  Was that option considered and rejected?
