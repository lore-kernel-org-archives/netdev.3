docs: netmem: document netmem and memory provider design principles

This commit adds a Design Principles section to
Documentation/networking/netmem.rst. The section covers the netmem_ref
abstraction, the rule against downcasting, decoupling memory providers
from net_iov and net_iov from unreadability, and delegating type-specific
logic to the lower layers. It also adds a rule against mixing skb fragment
memory sources.

[Severity: Low]
Can netmem_address() reliably test readability for page-backed netmem?
For pages, it ends up calling page_address():

include/net/netmem.h:netmem_address() {
	if (netmem_is_net_iov(netmem))
		return NULL;

	return __netmem_address(netmem);
}

With CONFIG_HIGHMEM, page_address() in mm/highmem.c returns NULL for a
highmem page that has no permanent mapping. The CPU can still read that
page through kmap_local_page(), which item 1 uses as its example.

Highmem page frags are normal in skbs on 32-bit kernels. They come from
sendfile/splice or from MSG_ZEROCOPY user pages.

Could new code that follows this advice and treats a NULL return from
netmem_address() as "unreadable" wrongly reject or skip valid highmem page
frags?

The same advice appears in the struct net_iov comment in
include/net/netmem.h. That comment was added by "net: netmem: document
netmem and memory provider design in comments".

Would it be more accurate to say that a NULL netmem_address() means "no
permanent kernel mapping"? Another option is to point only to
skb_frags_readable() or to a dedicated netmem readability helper.

[Severity: Medium]
Is this invariant enforced anywhere today? Items 2 and 3 note that some
existing code does not follow them yet, but this item has no such note.

The companion commit "net: netmem: document netmem and memory provider
design in comments" adds this comment in skb_try_coalesce():

net/core/skbuff.c:skb_try_coalesce() {
    ...
	/* All frags in an skb must either all be struct page-backed or all
	 * belong to the same memory provider instance; do not coalesce skbs
	 * that would mix them.
	 */
	if (skb_frags_readable(from) != skb_frags_readable(to))
		return false;
    ...
}

skb_frags_readable() only returns !skb->unreadable. Two unreadable skbs
can carry net_iovs from different devmem bindings, or from a devmem
binding and an io_uring zcrx area. Both would pass this check, and their
frags would then be merged.

Other places look similar:

- tcp_skb_can_collapse() in include/net/tcp.h compares only readability.
- skb_gro_receive() in net/core/gro.c checks pp_recycle and skb_zcopy(),
  but not readability or provider identity.

On TX, tcp_sendmsg_locked() looks up the binding again on every sendmsg
call with net_devmem_get_binding(sk, sockc.dmabuf_id). Before it appends
to the tail skb, it only checks:

	if (copy <= 0 || !tcp_skb_can_collapse_to(skb) ||
	    unlikely(skb_frags_readable(skb) != !binding)) {

msg_zerocopy_realloc() then extends the tail skb's uarg. Because of that,
the -EEXIST check in skb_zerocopy_iter_stream() never triggers.

bind-tx does not require privileges. Could a user bind two dmabufs to one
netdev, then send two back-to-back MSG_ZEROCOPY sendmsg calls with
different dmabuf_ids? That would leave net_iovs from two bindings in one
skb.

validate_xmit_unreadable_skb() in net/core/dev.c already relies on this
invariant, because it only checks frags[0]:

	niov = netmem_to_net_iov(skb_frag_netmem(&shinfo->frags[0]));
	if (net_is_devmem_iov(niov) &&
	    READ_ONCE(net_devmem_iov_binding(niov)->dev) != dev)
		goto out_free;

Should these places get a provider-identity check? Otherwise, could this
item and the skb_try_coalesce() comment say that only readability is
enforced today, the way items 2 and 3 describe their own limitations?

[Severity: Low]
Do items 2 and 5 conflict once a page-backed memory provider exists?

Item 2 says "a memory provider that returns struct page-backed
netmem_refs to upper layers is allowed". A frag from such a provider
fits both categories in the first sentence here: "struct page-backed"
and "same memory provider instance". Read that way, it could share an
skb with ordinary page frags, or with page frags from a different
page-backed provider. skb_try_coalesce() would allow that today.

The second sentence, however, forbids "Mixing struct page and
memory-provider fragments, or mixing fragments from different memory
providers".

The new skb_frag_t comment in include/linux/skbuff.h uses the same
wording.

Could the two categories be stated so they don't overlap? For example,
"non-provider struct pages" versus "frags from a single provider
instance, whatever their backing".
