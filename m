selftests/net: test network sysctl extremes

This adds a new kselftest, sysctl_net_test. It unshares a network
namespace, searches for the accepted lower and upper bounds of each value
in ipv4/tcp_rmem and ipv4/tcp_wmem, and runs TCP and UDP loopback traffic
at each bound. While it runs, it also watches /dev/kmsg for kernel splats.

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but the "Drop udp_rmem_min and udp_wmem_min" paragraph
describes a change from an earlier posting. This commit creates
sysctl_net_test.c from scratch, so nothing is dropped in git history.
Should that text go below the --- line with the rest of the changelog?

The subject "test network sysctl extremes" also sounds broader than the
code. representative_sysctls[] only lists ipv4/tcp_rmem and
ipv4/tcp_wmem.

The body doesn't say that the test reads the global /dev/kmsg and fails
on any kernel splat. It also doesn't say that the test skips when
/dev/kmsg can't be opened or seeked, or when printk records are lost.
Could the commit message describe this?

Also, "Tested:" isn't a standard trailer.

[Severity: Medium]
Do these patterns match what the kernel prints today? Several of them
don't seem to line up with the current format strings.

For WARN, __warn() in kernel/panic.c prints:

	pr_warn("WARNING: %s:%d at %pS, CPU#%d: %s/%d\n", ...
	pr_warn("WARNING: at %pS, CPU#%d: %s/%d\n", ...

So the "WARNING: CPU: <n> PID: <n>" parser later in check_kernel_log()
can never match. WARNs are only caught by the "cut here" entry.

For x86 oopses, __die_header() in arch/x86/kernel/dumpstack.c prints:

	"Oops: %s: %04lx [#%d]%s%s%s%s\n", str, err & 0xffff,

page_fault_oops() passes "Oops" as str, so the record reads
"Oops: Oops: 0000 [#1] ...". The error_prefixes check:

	splat = *p == ' ' && isxdigit((unsigned char)p[1]);

rejects that record ('O' is not a hex digit). It also rejects
"Oops: general protection fault: ..." and "Oops: invalid opcode: ...".
No record starts with the bare "general protection fault:" or
"invalid opcode:" prefixes. Only "Oops: divide error" matches, and only
because 'd' happens to be a hex digit.

On x86, a kernel NULL dereference goes through show_fault_oops() in
arch/x86/mm/fault.c:

	pr_alert("BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: %px\n",

That string isn't in splats[], which only has the "BUG: unable to
handle" branch. The die() path prints no "cut here" line, so nothing
matches a NULL dereference.

On arm64, __die() in arch/arm64/kernel/traps.c prints
"Internal error: %s: %016lx [#%d] SMP", and die_kernel_fault() prints
"Unable to handle kernel %s at virtual address". Neither is matched,
even though the commit notes cite an arm64 run.

watchdog_hardlockup_check() in kernel/watchdog.c prints:

	pr_emerg("CPU%u: Watchdog detected hard LOCKUP on cpu %u\n", ...);

So the "watchdog: BUG: hard LOCKUP" entry never matches anything.

Lockdep also prints "WARNING: possible recursive locking detected",
"WARNING: inconsistent lock state", "WARNING: suspicious RCU usage",
"WARNING: bad unlock balance detected!" and others with no "cut here"
line. Only the circular dependency report is listed.

An oops can happen in softirq, a timer or a kworker, for example in TCP
timers or loopback RX at an extreme rmem/wmem value. If it does, the
test keeps running and reports a pass. Could these patterns be updated
to match the current format strings?

[Severity: Medium]
Can a task still fake a splat here? The v3 notes say the matcher no
longer matches task-controlled "BUG:" text. However, some facility 0
kernel records start with the task comm, and those get past this
filter.

On x86, show_signal_msg() in arch/x86/mm/fault.c does:

	printk("%s%s[%d]: segfault at %lx ip %px sp %px error %lx",
		loglvl, tsk->comm, task_pid_nr(tsk), address,

show_unhandled_signals defaults to 1. On arm64, arm64_show_signal()
does:

	pr_info("%s[%d]: unhandled exception: ", tsk->comm, ...);

TASK_COMM_LEN is 16, so a comm can be up to 15 characters. /dev/kmsg
isn't namespaced, so any unprivileged process on the host can do this:

	prctl(PR_SET_NAME, "BUG: KASAN:");
	/* then take an unhandled SIGSEGV */

The record "BUG: KASAN:[pid]: segfault at ..." matches the
"BUG: KASAN:" entry in splats[], so the test fails with "kernel splat
detected".

Other comms work the same way:

  "Oops: 0" matches the "Oops:" prefix, since a space and a hex digit
  follow it.

  "divide error: a" is exactly 15 characters.

  "UBSAN: x" passes the isalpha() check.

The validation in the notes only used the comm "BUG:", which is shorter
than every pattern, so it doesn't cover this case.

[Severity: Low]
Should the bound found here be checked against an expected value?
find_bound() takes whatever value the kernel accepts as the correct
bound.

Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.rst says each tcp_rmem value "cannot
be set below 4096". net/ipv4/sysctl_net_ipv4.c enforces this with:

	.extra1		= &tcp_min_rcvbuf,

Suppose that minimum regresses. The notes describe a vendor 6.12.57
kernel that accepted tcp_rmem[1]=1 and sent zero-window SYN/SYN-ACKs.
The test would just find the new bound and run traffic there.

The verdict in main() only needs one success, so the arm64 run with TCP
11/12 would still pass.

> +				      strerror(errno));
> +		ksft_finished();
> +	}

[Severity: Medium]
Does this exit with KSFT_PASS instead of KSFT_SKIP?
ksft_test_result_skip() increments ksft_cnt.ksft_xskip, and
ksft_finished() is defined as:

	#define ksft_finished()			\
		ksft_exit(ksft_plan ==		\
			  ksft_cnt.ksft_pass +	\
			  ksft_cnt.ksft_xpass +	\
			  ksft_cnt.ksft_xfail +	\
			  ksft_cnt.ksft_xskip)

With a plan of 1 and one skip, the condition is true and
ksft_exit_pass() exits with 0. run_one() in kselftest/runner.sh tells
pass from skip only by the exit code, so the run is recorded as a pass.

main() uses the same pattern for the /dev/kmsg open and seek failures,
for the loopback failure, and for the "no selected writable numeric
network sysctls found" case. It also uses it for the
kernel_log_incomplete case, which v3 added so that an incomplete splat
check would not count as a pass.

Would ksft_exit_skip() be the right call for these whole-test skips?

> +
> +	kmsg_fd = open("/dev/kmsg", O_RDONLY | O_NONBLOCK | O_CLOEXEC);

[Severity: Low]
Should the result of this test depend on the global kernel log?
unshare(CLONE_NEWNET) isolates the sysctls, but /dev/kmsg is
system-wide.

check_kernel_log() runs after every probe and traffic step. A WARN from
unrelated work running at the same time, such as other selftests,
drivers or kworkers, would fail this test with "kernel splat detected".

Also, a printk burst that causes EPIPE sets kernel_log_incomplete. The
whole run is then reported as a skip, even if every sysctl and traffic
check passed:

	if (kernel_log_incomplete) {
		...
		ksft_test_result_skip("cannot complete kernel splat check\n");

netdev CI already scans dmesg after each test. Is a separate check
needed here?

[ ... ]

> +		set_failure("loopback delivery incomplete: TCP %zu/%zu, UDP %zu/%zu",
> +			    tcp_successes, tcp_attempts,
> +			    udp_successes, udp_attempts);

[Severity: Medium]
Is this check strict enough? When delivery fails,
run_loopback_traffic() only copies the first error into
tcp_delivery_failure or udp_delivery_failure. That string is printed as
a '#' comment, and set_failure() is never called.

So the test only fails here when every TCP attempt fails or every UDP
attempt fails. With TCP 1/12 or UDP 1/12, main() still reaches:

	ksft_test_result_pass("TCP/UDP loopback smoke: TCP %zu/%zu, UDP %zu/%zu\n",

The arm64 run in the notes had one TCP timeout in 12 attempts at
tcp_rmem[1]=1, and it would be reported as a pass.

Should a delivery failure at any bound fail the test?
