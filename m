net/rds: guard every work-requeueing site with rds_destroy_pending()

This patch wraps five work-arming sites in the rcu_read_lock() plus
rds_destroy_pending() pattern that the other arming sites already use.
The sites are the IB send completion and credit paths, rds_ib_recv_refill(),
rds_tcp_accept_one() and rds_sendmsg(). The goal is to stop new work
being queued on a path workqueue once rds_conn_destroy() has started
cancelling it.

> The IB completion sites are reachable from soft-irq at any point
> before the QP is drained, so a completion landing in the window
> between the cancel and destroy_workqueue() in rds_conn_path_destroy()
> re-arms a work on a workqueue that is about to be destroyed: with
> delay 0 the work is queued directly on the freed workqueue, and with
> delay 1 the timer survives destroy_workqueue() unseen and fires
> afterwards, queueing from a timer_list that lives in the freed c_path
> array.

[Severity: Low]
At this commit, can any of the five newly guarded sites actually fire
while rds_conn_destroy() is running?

Here rds_destroy_pending() is still only:

net/rds/rds.h:rds_destroy_pending() {
	return !check_net(rds_conn_net(conn)) ||
	       (conn->c_trans->t_unloading && conn->c_trans->t_unloading(conn));
}

The teardown paths that reach rds_conn_destroy() seem to keep these
sites out of the window between the cancel and destroy_workqueue() in
rds_conn_path_destroy().

For IB, rds_conn_destroy() is only called from
rds_ib_exit()->rds_ib_destroy_nodev_conns(), and that function only takes
connections from ib_nodev_conns:

- rds_ib_setup_qp() takes the connection off that list with
  rds_ib_add_conn() before it calls rdma_create_qp().
- rds_ib_conn_path_shutdown() puts it back with rds_ib_remove_conn()
  only after disable_work_sync() on i_send_work/i_recv_work and after
  rdma_destroy_qp().

So wouldn't every IB connection that reaches rds_conn_destroy() have no
QP or CQ? That would leave rds_ib_send_cqe_handler(),
rds_ib_send_add_credits() and rds_ib_recv_refill() with nothing to
deliver.

For the TCP accept path, rds_tcp_kill_sock() clears
rtn->rds_tcp_listen_sock and flushes rds_tcp_accept_w in
rds_tcp_listen_stop() before it destroys any connection. After that,
rds_tcp_accept_one() returns early:

	if (!listen_sock) /* module unload or netns delete in progress */
		return -ENETUNREACH;

rds_tcp_exit() also calls unregister_pernet_device() before
rds_tcp_destroy_conns().

For rds_sendmsg(), the sending socket holds a reference on its netns.
rs_transport is also pinned with try_module_get() in
rds_trans_get_preferred(). So the new guard there looks like it always
evaluates to false.

The guards seem to take effect only with the follow-up patch, "net/rds:
make rds_destroy_pending() report a connection's own destroy", which adds
the c_destroy_in_prog term. That patch also says the last stragglers
"were converted by the previous patch".

There is one narrow interleaving where the IB guards could matter at
this commit. A CM handler could fetch rds_ibdev through
rds_ib_get_client_data() before rds_ib_remove_one() clears it. It could
then call rds_ib_add_conn() after the sweep's list_splice() and bring up
a QP while rds_conn_destroy() is running. That path already corrupts the
sweep's on-stack list, and the commit message does not describe it.

Would it be more accurate to describe this as preparation for the next
patch? The Fixes: tag could then be adjusted or dropped, or this patch
could be folded into the one that extends the predicate.

The Fixes: tag also doesn't seem to match the rds_sendmsg() hunk. The
cp_conn_w queue site there came from 9d27a0fb122f, not from
ebeeb1ad9b8a. The IB queue lines were rewritten to use cp_wq by
d327e2e74aedbe.

A stable backport chosen from this tag would do nothing on its own. The
rds_sendmsg() hunk would also lack context in older trees.
