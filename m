ibmveth: Implement incremental MQ RX queue resize

This patch adds ibmveth_resize_rx_queues_incremental() and
ibmveth_resize_rx_channels(), so ethtool -L can change the live RX queue
count without tearing down the device. Scale-up allocates, registers and
unmasks the new subordinate queues. Scale-down quiesces, drains and
deregisters the retiring ones, and both directions roll back on failure.

[Severity: Low]

This isn't a bug, but three of the new comments don't match the code.

The updated ibmveth_restart_rx_queue() comment lists open and scale-down
rollback as its callers. ibmveth_scale_up_rx_queues() also calls it in
three places: after each successful queue bring-up, on the keep path after
a failed destroy, and on the cleanup_new_queues keep path.

The new ibmveth_schedule_rx_queue() comment says callers treat false as
"queue is gone". ibmveth_restart_rx_queue() does the opposite on false:

	if (ibmveth_schedule_rx_queue(adapter, qindex))
		return;

	ibmveth_enable_irq(adapter, qindex);

A caller that follows the comment would unmask PHYP on a retired queue.

The ibmveth_cleanup_single_rx_interrupt() kdoc says "Used during
incremental scale-down". It also runs on the scale-up failure paths via
ibmveth_destroy_subordinate_rx_queue().

Could these comments be updated?

[Severity: Low]

If ibmveth_deregister_single_rx_queue() fails here, queue i keeps its
buffer list page, the dma_map_single() of that page, the
dma_alloc_coherent() RX ring and its pool arrays. queue_handle[i] also
stays set above the live count. The IRQ setup failure branch below does
the same.

Only ibmveth_free_stranded_rx_queues() frees such a queue, and it runs
only from ibmveth_close() when H_FREE_LOGICAL_LAN succeeds:

	if (!ibmveth_free_all_queues(adapter))
		ibmveth_free_stranded_rx_queues(adapter);

If H_FREE_LOGICAL_LAN fails in close, does this leak the stranded queue's
page, RX ring and DMA mapping? The out_free_all_queues unwind in
ibmveth_open() and ibmveth_remove() also don't seem to release queues
above the live count.

After a failed close, queue_handle[i] also stays set. Every later scale-up
that reaches index i then returns -EBUSY with the "reset pending" message,
but that path doesn't schedule a reset.

In the same failed-close case, the live queues' memory is freed anyway.
Keeping only the stranded queue's memory looks inconsistent.

[Severity: Medium]

Can this unmask PHYP behind a live poll?

Once ibmveth_enable_irq() unmasks queue i, an interrupt on another CPU can
run ibmveth_interrupt(), win napi_schedule_prep(), mask PHYP and schedule
NAPI. ibmveth_restart_rx_queue() then sees its own prep fail and falls
back to:

	ibmveth_enable_irq(adapter, qindex);

That unmasks PHYP while the poll owns the queue. When the poll completes,
it calls ibmveth_enable_irq() again on a source that is already enabled.
ibmveth_toggle_irq() folds H_PARAMETER to success only on disable:

	if (h_rc == H_PARAMETER && !enable) {

So on enable it returns -EIO, and ibmveth_poll() schedules a reset.

The v6 changelog gives this case as the reason the survivor restart loop
was dropped: "enable_irq() on prep-fail unmasks behind a live poll
(subordinate H_PARAMETER on enable is -EIO and reset)".

The same enable-then-restart sequence appears in four places:

- here
- the keep branch after a failed destroy
- the cleanup_new_queues keep loop
- both rollback loops in ibmveth_scale_down_rx_queues()

On a busy link, would an ethtool -L that otherwise succeeded end in an
adapter reset?

[Severity: Medium]

At this point real_num_rx_queues has already been lowered to old_count,
and keep is above old_count. Growing the count goes through
net_rx_queue_update_kobjects(), which can fail (for example with -ENOMEM).
netif_set_real_num_rx_queues() then leaves dev->real_num_rx_queues
unchanged.

If that happens, is it safe to still replenish, napi_enable() and unmask
queues old_count..keep-1? Packets on those queues would carry
skb_record_rx_queue() indexes at or above real_num_rx_queues. That hits
the WARN_ONCE in get_rps_cpu() and the bypass in netif_get_rxqueue(),
which is what widening real_num up front in this function is meant to
avoid.

The destroy failure path in ibmveth_scale_down_rx_queues() has the same
pattern, after real_num has been lowered to new_count:

		if (netif_set_real_num_rx_queues(netdev, keep))
			schedule_work(&adapter->work);
		for (i = new_count; i < keep; i++) {

[Severity: Medium]

The RX resize is committed here, before any TX work. If a TX LTB
allocation later fails in ibmveth_set_channels(), the code does:

		goal = old;
		old = i;
		break;
	}
	rc = netif_set_real_num_tx_queues(netdev, goal);

This overwrites the allocation error with the result of reverting to the
old TX count, which is normally 0.

For a combined ethtool -L rx N tx M on an opened MQ adapter, would this
change RX, leave TX unchanged and still report success? Nothing at this
commit rolls RX back.

The last patch in the series, "ibmveth: Complete set_channels down-path
and mq_fallback max_rx cap", adds rx_changed tracking, a rollback through
ibmveth_resize_rx_queues_incremental(adapter, old_rx, ...), and a return
of rc ? rc : -ENOMEM when real_num_tx_queues doesn't match the request.
That fixes it by the end of the series, but the behavior above is still
present at this commit.
