The HiperSockets receive callbacks change sk_state under bh_lock_sock()
without checking sock_owned_by_user(), so a FIN or SYN|ACK is applied
while a task owns the socket and acts on the state it read. recvmsg()
takes no socket lock and sends a due window update in any state, even
after the FIN; one that fails keeps its credit.

Take bh_lock_sock() once in afiucv_hs_rcv(). While a task owns the
socket, a SYN|ACK, SYN|FIN or FIN is recorded in the socket and applied
by the owner from proto->release_cb: nothing resends a control frame,
so none may be dropped, as the socket backlog drops a pfmemalloc skb.
Data, SHT and WIN frames do not change sk_state, so they go through
under sk_lock.slock, reading a state the owner may be changing: a data
frame queues or is dropped, a WIN credits the sender, and
iucv_sock_destruct() now purges backlog_skb_q for one that queued after
close(). They wait in the socket backlog while the reply to our SYN is
pending, and behind frames already waiting, counted in frames rather
than bytes, up to the window we gave the peer plus one, which a
conforming peer does not exceed; the reply is applied before them. A
listener's SYNs wait the same way, cut to their header, up to its
accept queue plus one; past that, or when the backlog cannot take the
skb, they are refused at once, without a child, and so is one the
listener cannot take when it is applied: closed, or its accept queue
full, meanwhile. A SYN|ACK or SYN|FIN no socket state can use is freed
in afiucv_hs_rcv(), a SYN for a socket that does not listen refused
there.

The window given to the peer is kept in msglimit_adv: the SYN carries
msglimit, and SO_MSGLIMIT may lower msglimit while the reply is
awaited. The backlog budget, the receive check in recvmsg() and the
window-update threshold read the window advertised, which a conforming
peer keeps to. recvmsg() runs under lock_sock() on both transports and
sleeps without it; a reader parked when the connection goes sees EOF
once nothing is left, as a fresh call does. A due window update goes
out only while connected, else the credit is dropped. shutdown() sets
RCV_SHUTDOWN and purges under the socket spinlock, where the data path
tests it. sendmsg() waits for memory without the lock and fails with
EPIPE once sending is shut down. Control frames go out after
shutdown(SHUT_WR) without clearing SEND_SHUTDOWN around their
allocation; the FIN and the first SHT go out past sk_sndbuf, as qeth
keeps sent skbs charged until TX completion.

v2:
- control frames that arrive while a task owns the socket (SYN|ACK,
  SYN|FIN, FIN) are recorded in iucv_sock (hs_pending, the SYN|ACK's
  window with it) and applied from iucv_proto.release_cb; the first
  reply to our SYN decides, a FIN applies after it. The backlog keeps
  data, SHT and WIN frames while the reply to our SYN is pending or
  behind frames already waiting, and a listener's SYNs; a SYN that
  waits is cut to its header and holds its device for the reply, and
  is refused without a child if the listener closed, or its accept
  queue filled, meanwhile.
  afiucv_hs_backlog_rcv() applies a pending reply before the frame it
  runs; a socket closed meanwhile applies nothing (__iucv_sock_close()
  leaves IUCV_BOUND as it is). The refusal test there repeats the one in
  afiucv_hs_callback_syn(), which still allocates the child before it
  tests; moving that allocation, and freeing the child on the refusal
  and transmit-failure paths, is the pre-existing leak Hidayath's fix
  covers, and this patch does not touch that path.
- the rework stays one patch: the lock in afiucv_hs_rcv(), the
  record/apply pair and the backlog budget each close a window the
  others open; msglimit_adv is the budget's window; recvmsg() under
  lock_sock() is what makes release_cb() the owner's point.
- iucv_sock_destruct() purges backlog_skb_q: a data frame that races
  __iucv_sock_close()'s purge under sk_lock.slock is freed with the
  socket instead of leaking (pre-existing; the bypass path makes it a
  question this patch has to answer)
- msglimit_adv records the window advertised in the SYN (on the
  listener's child, in the SYN|ACK); the data budget, the msg_recv
  check in recvmsg() and the window-update threshold read it. The
  WRITE_ONCE() on msglimit in setsockopt() is gone with it. (The AI
  review's item on v1; Hidayath's reproducer, SO_MSGLIMIT lowered in
  IUCV_BOUND, lost data on v1.)
- afiucv_hs_stray(): unknown flags, and a SYN|ACK or SYN|FIN for a
  socket not in IUCV_BOUND, are freed in afiucv_hs_rcv() as NO_SOCKET;
  a SYN for a socket that does not listen is refused there without
  allocating a child
- iucv_sock_shutdown() takes sk_lock.slock around the sk_shutdown set
  and the purge on HiperSockets; the z/VM branch is unchanged
- iucv_sock_recv_skb() returns EOF when the socket is IUCV_DISCONN with
  nothing queued, as the shortcut at the top of recvmsg() does
- afiucv_hs_dispatch() is defined before its callers; the declarations
  of afiucv_hs_backlog_rcv() and afiucv_hs_release_cb() stay, with the
  file's four: iucv_proto and iucv_sock_alloc() point at them, and they
  dispatch to the SYN handler, which allocates sockets. The old block
  comment on the no-socket case went with the move; the dispatcher's
  comment says what a NULL socket means
- the SHT accounting, the WARN_ON on the overrun path and the hs_dev
  ordering are fixes in net now; the commit message is shorter
v1: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20261011-b4-disp-410518f4-v1-1-753bf3258292@proton.me/

Tested on s390x under QEMU TCG (no Z here), net-next 8df0638138d3,
KASAN + PROVE_LOCKING + DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP, as v1 was, with one change
in the setup: instead of lo and injected SYN|ACKs, the guest now has two
emulated HiperSockets adapters on one LAN under the real qeth and qdio
drivers, so every SYN, SYN|ACK, FIN and window update is a frame af_iucv
itself sent and received, and tx completion is the adapter's: at once,
late (QAOB), or parked while the peer has no receive buffer. The z/VM
transport runs against an emulated CP (IUCV CONNECT, SEND, SEVER as the
CP Programming Services book describes them). Two vCPUs under -icount
for all but one test, MTTCG at HZ=100 for that one. The emulation does
what the drivers expect; where they leave a choice, the choice is mine.

The default set is 53 tests. net-next fails 8 of them: data sent after
the socket's own SHT by a writer parked on the window, and a writer
that waits out SO_SNDTIMEO after that shutdown; -EFAULT instead of EOF
when the SHT's empty frame is counted past the window; a SHT and the
FIN of a device going down lost to a full send buffer; a window update
after the peer's FIN; -ECONNRESET for a stream the socket shut down
itself; a reader parked at the FIN woken to -ENOTCONN. v1 fails the
last one only. This series fails none, with no KASAN or
lockdep report. The opt-in tests: SO_MSGLIMIT lowered in IUCV_BOUND
(three forms: before the SYN|ACK, with the reader holding the socket,
with the minimum SO_RCVBUF), a stray SYN|ACK and junk ahead of the FIN,
a repeated SYN ahead of it, the SHT past the window, the leaked child
of a refused SYN, a reader blocked at the FIN and poll() after it,
shutdown(SHUT_RD) against a frame in flight under a probe that widens
the gap (udelay(50) on both sides), the z/VM group, and two readers at
once under MTTCG. With this series: all 8 messages arrive in the three
forms (v1 delivers 3 of 8 in two of them; net-next delivers 8 and
closes the socket with -EFAULT in the third); the FIN is applied in
both stray tests where v1 loses it; EOF for the SHT past the window
where net-next gives WARN and -EFAULT; the parked reader gets EOF and
poll() reports EPOLLRDHUP, -ENOTCONN and no RDHUP on net-next and v1;
0 reads of data after SHUT_RD in 200 under the probe over three seeds,
17 to 21 without the spinlock; the z/VM sever wakes the sleeping reader
with EOF, -ENOTCONN on net-next; net-next fails the two-reader test in
all three MTTCG runs, this series passes them. The refused SYN leaks
its child on every kernel, as Hidayath reported: 1056 refused leave
1056 sockets behind, and the control that accepts its 17 frees all 17.

10 kernels each remove or weaken one piece of this series. Nine fail a
test this series passes: the budget on the live SO_MSGLIMIT loses data
(3 of 8); release_cb() applying nothing leaves connect() waiting for a
SYN|ACK the socket recorded; the SYN reply applied only after the
backlog dispatches data in IUCV_BOUND and loses it; the SHT counted
gives -EFAULT where this series gives EOF; shutdown without the spinlock
gives the 17 to 21 late reads above, under the probe only; the wait
loop without EOF on IUCV_DISCONN gives -ENOTCONN at the z/VM sever; 1/2
without 2/2 gives EOF without RDHUP; the fixes of [3] alone fail
net-next's set minus the window refusal; and the kernel that defers
nothing (every frame dispatched under the owner, net-next's race) shows
data to poll() on a socket a task owns, in the window tests, and three
default tests log it as applying where this series defers. One passes
every test: the kernel without the stray filter in afiucv_hs_rcv()
records a stray control frame and applies it as a no-op on release
instead of freeing it, which only the probe sees. Two pre-existing z/VM
findings show on every kernel and are read as such.

Not covered: real hardware, KCSAN (your run is the witness for the
sk_shutdown race), and the z/VM callbacks' sk_state writes, which this
series does not touch. Logs on request.
