net/rds: keep the connected peer's scope id apart from the bound one

This patch adds rs_conn_scope_id to struct rds_sock. rds_connect() now
stores the link-local peer's scope there instead of overloading
rs_bound_scope_id. The rds_bind() check, the destination-less send,
getpeername() and recvmsg() are updated to use the new field.

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but rds_connect() writes
rs_conn_scope_id under lock_sock(). This line and rds_recvmsg() read it
without the lock. Could a concurrent connect() hand back an old
address with a new scope?

The same race was already there with rs_bound_scope_id, and
rds_getname() already starts with "racey, don't care". The field is an
aligned u32, so reads can't tear. Adding READ_ONCE()/WRITE_ONCE()
would only silence KCSAN, if that is wanted.

[Severity: Medium]
Can this report the wrong scope for senders other than the connected
peer?

connect() doesn't filter incoming traffic. rds_recv_incoming() picks
the socket by local address, port and c_bound_if only:

net/rds/recv.c:rds_recv_incoming() {
    ...
	rs = rds_find_bound(daddr, inc->i_hdr.h_dport, conn->c_bound_if);
    ...
}

__rds_conn_create() sets c_bound_if to 0 when the local address is not
link-local:

	if (ipv6_addr_type(laddr) & IPV6_ADDR_LINKLOCAL)
		conn->c_bound_if = dev_if;
	else
		conn->c_bound_if = 0;

So a connected socket bound to a global address receives from every
peer on every interface.

Take connect(fe80::x%ifA) followed by bind(2001:db8::a). Before this
patch, bind() overwrote rs_bound_scope_id with 0, so recvmsg reported
scope 0. Now rs_conn_scope_id stays at ifA, and every IPv6 sender is
reported with scope ifA.

That includes global senders. It also includes a link-local sender
fe80::z whose connection arrived on ifB. rds_tcp_accept_one() takes
c_dev_if from sk_bound_dev_if, which is the incoming interface for a
link-local peer.

Suppose the application replies with sendto(fe80::z%ifA).
rds_sendmsg() takes scope_id = ifA. This check passes because
rs_bound_scope_id is 0:

		if (scope_id != rs->rs_bound_scope_id) {
			if (!scope_id) {
				scope_id = rs->rs_bound_scope_id;
			} else if (rs->rs_bound_scope_id) {
				...
				ret = -EINVAL;

rds_conn_create_outgoing(..., ifA) then sends the reply out the wrong
link. It either sits on a connection that never comes up, or reaches
whatever host owns fe80::z on ifA. Before the patch, the equivalent
sendto(fe80::z%0) failed with -EINVAL.

The commit message says:

  recvmsg() reports a sender with the connected peer's scope when there
  is one and the bound scope otherwise, as before.

Does that hold for the connect-then-bind order?

Could the scope come from the connection the message arrived on
instead? That would be inc->i_conn->c_dev_if for a link-local sender
and 0 otherwise. inc->i_conn is already dereferenced a few lines
earlier for inc_copy_to_user().

[Severity: Low]
Can getpeername() and recvmsg() now report different scopes for the
same connected peer?

rds_getname() with peer set reports only rs_conn_scope_id. This line
falls back to rs_bound_scope_id. Take bind(fe80::l%ifC) followed by
connect(2001::p). rs_conn_scope_id is 0 and rs_bound_scope_id is ifC:

  getpeername()  -> 2001::p, scope 0
  recvfrom()     -> 2001::p, scope ifC

Before the patch both read rs_bound_scope_id and agreed (ifC).
Userspace that compares the full sockaddr_in6 from getpeername() and
recvfrom() to spot datagrams from its connected peer will now see a
mismatch.

The getpeername() value follows the inet6_getname() convention of 0
for a global address. The bound-scope fallback in recvmsg is the odd
one out. Taking the scope from the sender, as suggested above, would
fix this too.

[Severity: Low]
This is a pre-existing issue, but does the new comment still hold if
bind() runs between the two lock_sock() sections?

scope_id is sampled here. The lock is then dropped and taken again:

	lock_sock(sk);
	if (ipv6_addr_any(&rs->rs_bound_addr) || ipv6_addr_any(&daddr)) {
		...
	} else if (namelen != 0) {
		...
		if (scope_id != rs->rs_bound_scope_id) {

The bound-scope fixup only runs when namelen != 0. Take a socket that
is connected to a global peer but not yet bound. It calls send() with
no destination while another thread runs bind(fe80::a%ifA) in that
window.

The send then sees a bound socket but keeps scope_id = 0. It calls
rds_conn_create_outgoing() with laddr fe80::a and dev_if 0, and
rds_tcp_conn_path_connect() can't bind that address with scope 0.

The code before this patch read rs_bound_scope_id in the same first
section, so the race isn't new. Merging the two critical sections
would close it.
