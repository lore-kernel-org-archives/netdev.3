net/smc: order the CDC receive path against RMB publication

This patch moves the conn->rmb_desc assignment in __smc_buf_create() after
the other receive fields and makes it a release store. smc_cdc_rx_handler()
now uses an acquire load and drops a CDC whose connection has no rmb_desc
yet. The goal is to stop a CDC with a predicted token from reaching a NULL
rmb_desc in softirq.

Closes: https://sashiko.dev/#/patchset/20261008-b4-disp-f7cd3d96-v6-0-fba616c0920c@proton.me?part=1

[Severity: High]
Can a NULL check tell us that the current registration's RMB is ready?
Nothing ever resets conn->rmb_desc to NULL. smc_buf_unuse() releases the
RMB and leaves the pointer in place, and smc_conn_create() does not clear
it either.

On the SMC-R listen path, smc_listen_find_device() can try V2 and then
fall back to V1 on the same conn:

smc_find_rdma_v2_device_serv()
  smc_listen_rdma_init()
    smc_conn_create()        /* token registered */
    smc_buf_create()         /* rmb_desc published */
  smc_listen_rdma_reg()      /* fails */
  smc_conn_abort()
    smc_conn_free()
      smc_buf_unuse()
        smcr_buf_unuse()     /* frees or pools the RMB */

smc_find_rdma_v1_device_serv()
  smc_listen_rdma_init()
    smc_conn_create()        /* new token, rmb_desc still stale */
    smc_buf_create()

smcr_buf_unuse() has two outcomes here. If smcr_link_reg_buf() set
is_reg_err, it frees the descriptor through smc_buf_free(). If the peer
failed CONFIRM_RKEY in smcr_lgr_reg_rmbs(), it zeroes the buffer and
returns it to the pool with used=0.

Suppose a CDC with the new token arrives before __smc_buf_create()
publishes the new RMB. That is the same window the commit message
describes. Wouldn't it pass the new check, since the stale pointer is
non-NULL?

smc_cdc_msg_recv_action() would then read conn->rmb_desc->len, and
smc_cdc_handle_urg_data_arrival() would read conn->rmb_desc->cpu_addr. The
descriptor behind them is either freed or owned by another connection.

The stale pointer also matters if the V1 retry fails in
__smc_buf_create(is_rmb). smc_conn_abort() then runs smc_buf_unuse() again:

	if (conn->rmb_desc) {
		bufsize = conn->rmb_desc->len;
		if (!is_smcd) {
			smcr_buf_unuse(conn->rmb_desc, true, lgr);

Could this double free the descriptor or corrupt the rmbs list?

Would it be better to reset conn->rmb_desc and conn->sndbuf_desc to NULL
when the buffers are released, or before the conn is registered again?
The follow-up patch "net/smc: skip the DMB nocopy accounting until the
send buffer is set" doesn't appear to change this.

[Severity: High]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but there is a related problem
at teardown. The comment says rmb_desc is never cleared. That is true of
the pointer value, but what about the lifetime of the object it points to?

smc_conn_free() releases the buffers before the conn leaves the token
tree:

	if (!list_empty(&lgr->list)) {
		smc_buf_unuse(conn, lgr); /* allow buffer reuse */
		smc_lgr_unregister_conn(conn);
	}

For SMC-R, smcr_buf_unuse() frees the descriptor through smc_buf_free()
when buf_desc->is_reg_err is set, for example after smcr_link_reg_buf()
failed. Otherwise it zeroes the buffer and sets used=0, so
smc_buf_get_slot() can hand it to another connection.

smc_cdc_rx_handler() doesn't check conn->freed, and it drops conns_lock
after sock_hold(). bh_lock_sock() doesn't wait for a lock_sock() owner,
and smc_conn_free() only waits for pending TX WRs.

Can a peer CDC that finds the conn before smc_lgr_unregister_conn() still
run smc_cdc_msg_recv_action() and smc_cdc_handle_urg_data_arrival()? If
so, they would read conn->rmb_desc->len and conn->rmb_desc->cpu_addr from
a freed or reassigned descriptor. The new check would pass here too,
since the stale pointer is non-NULL.

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but the new comment says the callees can
load rmb_desc plainly once it is set. Is the peer's producer cursor ever
checked against the RMB length?

smc_cdc_cursor_to_host() only rejects cursors that move backwards:

	temp.count = ntohl(net.count);
	temp.wrap = ntohs(net.wrap);
	if ((old.wrap > temp.wrap) && temp.wrap)
		return;
	if ((old.wrap == temp.wrap) &&
	    (old.count > temp.count))
		return;
	smc_curs_copy(local, &temp, conn);

smc_curs_diff() also doesn't cap its result at size, even though its
comment says the difference cannot exceed size.

So if prod_flags.urg_data_present is set and prod.count moves forward by
any amount, smc_cdc_msg_recv_action() calls
smc_cdc_handle_urg_data_arrival(), which does:

	base = (char *)conn->rmb_desc->cpu_addr + conn->rx_off;
	if (conn->urg_curs.count)
		conn->urg_rx_byte = *(base + conn->urg_curs.count - 1);

Could a peer-controlled urg_curs.count make this read up to about 4 GiB
past the RMB in softirq? An unmapped address would oops. A byte read from
a mapped address would be stored in conn->urg_rx_byte, and
smc_rx_recv_urg() copies it to user space through memcpy_to_msg() on
recv(MSG_OOB).

The follow-up patch in the series doesn't touch this path either.
