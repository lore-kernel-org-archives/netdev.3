net/rds: keep the connected peer's scope id apart from the bound one

This patch adds a separate rs_conn_scope_id field to struct rds_sock.
With it, rds_connect() no longer stores a link-local peer's scope in
rs_bound_scope_id. The connected-socket check in rds_bind() and the
destination-less path in rds_sendmsg() now use the new field.

[Severity: Medium]
The peer scope now lives only in rs_conn_scope_id. Does rds_getname()
still give getpeername() the right scope? Its peer branch still pairs
the connected address with the bound scope:

net/rds/af_rds.c:rds_getname() {
    ...
			sin6->sin6_addr = rs->rs_conn_addr;
			sin6->sin6_flowinfo = 0;
			/* scope_id is the same as in the bound address. */
			sin6->sin6_scope_id = rs->rs_bound_scope_id;
    ...
}

Before this patch, connect(fe80::x%ifA) on an unbound socket reported
fe80::x%ifA. With this patch it reports scope 0. bind(global) followed
by connect(fe80::x%ifB) also goes from ifB to 0. bind(fe80::a%ifA)
followed by connect(2001::1) reports ifA for a global peer.

rds_connect() and rds_sendmsg() both reject a link-local sockaddr_in6
with sin6_scope_id == 0. So the address getpeername() returns for a
link-local peer can't be passed back to connect() or sendto().

Should this read rs->rs_conn_scope_id instead? That would match the new
field's comment in rds.h ("scope of rs_conn_addr when it is link-local,
0 otherwise"). The later patch in this series doesn't change
rds_getname() either.

[Severity: Medium]
There is a similar question for rds_recvmsg(). It takes the sender's
scope from the socket's bound scope:

net/rds/recv.c:rds_recvmsg() {
    ...
				sin6->sin6_addr = inc->i_saddr;
				sin6->sin6_flowinfo = 0;
				sin6->sin6_scope_id = rs->rs_bound_scope_id;
    ...
}

Take bind(global) followed by connect(fe80::x%ifB). Before this patch,
rds_connect() left ifB in rs_bound_scope_id, so recvmsg() from the
connected peer reported fe80::x%ifB. Now rs_bound_scope_id stays 0.

The connection's laddr is global, so c_bound_if is 0. The message is
still delivered to the socket via:

rds_recv_incoming()->rds_find_bound(daddr, dport, conn->c_bound_if)

Does recvmsg() now report fe80::x with scope 0? rds_sendmsg() would
reject that address if it is used to reply. The same applies to the
connections that connect(fe80::x%ifA) followed by bind(global) can now
set up.

Using the bound scope as the sender's scope is older behavior. It also
affects unconnected global-bound sockets. The change in the connected
case comes from this patch, and the commit message doesn't mention it.

[Severity: High]
Can this break destination-less sends on a socket that is bound to a
link-local address and connected to a global peer? For example,
bind(fe80::y%ifA) and connect(2001:db8::1), in either order.

rds_connect() now sets rs_conn_scope_id to 0 for the global peer. So a
send() with msg_namelen == 0 gets scope_id 0, where it used to get ifA
from rs_bound_scope_id.

Later in rds_sendmsg(), the fallback to the bound scope only runs when
namelen != 0:

	} else if (namelen != 0) {
		...
		if (scope_id != rs->rs_bound_scope_id) {
			if (!scope_id) {
				scope_id = rs->rs_bound_scope_id;
		...

So rds_conn_create_outgoing() is called with laddr fe80::y and dev_if
0, which sets both c_dev_if and c_bound_if to 0.
rds_tcp_conn_path_connect() then binds with:

		sin6.sin6_addr = conn->c_laddr;
		...
		sin6.sin6_scope_id = conn->c_dev_if;

__inet6_bind() rejects a link-local bind without an interface with
-EINVAL.

Wouldn't every reconnect attempt fail, leaving the connected socket's
data queued on a connection that never comes up?

sendto(2001:db8::1) on the same socket still works because it inherits
rs_bound_scope_id. That means the two send paths now pick different
connections for the same peer.

The later patch "net/rds: include the scope id in the sendmsg
connection cache check" only changes the rs_conn cache check. It
doesn't seem to address this.

Would something like this work instead?

		scope_id = rs->rs_conn_scope_id ?: rs->rs_bound_scope_id;
