net: stmmac: retain DMA memory until hardware shutdown completes

Before rings and buffers are released on close, XDP/XSK replacement or a
failed open, this patch waits for the DMA engines to report idle. If
they do not, it falls back to a completed global reset. Configurations
the hardware may still reach are tracked on a list and kept until a
later successful reset, and XSK DMA references are held independently.
TX hard error recovery moves to the process-context reset path, and
resume-time descriptor cleanup moves after the reset.

[Severity: Medium]
Are the zero-copy XSK TX frames still in the retained TX ring ever
completed after a failed shutdown? Each one reserved a completion queue
slot in xsk_tx_peek_desc() through xskq_prod_reserve_addr().

After a later successful reset, the retained config is freed through
free_dma_desc_resources() -> dma_free_tx_skbufs(). There,
stmmac_free_tx_buffer() counts the STMMAC_TXBUF_T_XSK_TX entries in
xsk_frames_done, but the completion is gated on the pool pointer:

    if (tx_q->xsk_pool && tx_q->xsk_frames_done) {
        xsk_tx_completed(tx_q->xsk_pool, tx_q->xsk_frames_done);

tx_q->xsk_pool was already cleared here, so those frames are dropped.

The socket can stay bound across ifdown/ifup, an XDP program swap, or a
pool change on another queue. In that case the next open attaches the
same pool, which still holds k reserved but unsubmitted CQ slots.

xskq_prod_submit_n() publishes entries in reservation order. Wouldn't
every later completion then report an address k frames behind, with
those k CQ slots and UMEM frames lost for good?

[Severity: Medium]
Now that the in-IRQ restart is gone, TX recovery depends only on
stmmac_global_err() queueing the reset work. Can that request be lost?

stmmac_service_event_schedule() queues the work only when
STMMAC_SERVICE_SCHED is not already set:

    if (!test_bit(STMMAC_DOWN, &priv->state) &&
        !test_and_set_bit(STMMAC_SERVICE_SCHED, &priv->state))
            queue_work(priv->wq, &priv->service_task);

stmmac_reset_subtask() clears STMMAC_DOWN right after dev_open() has
re-requested the IRQs and restarted DMA. STMMAC_SERVICE_SCHED is only
cleared once the subtask returns:

stmmac_reset_subtask()
    dev_open(priv->dev, NULL);
    clear_bit(STMMAC_DOWN, &priv->state);
    clear_bit(STMMAC_RESETING, &priv->state);
    ...
stmmac_service_task()
    stmmac_reset_subtask(priv);
    clear_bit(STMMAC_SERVICE_SCHED, &priv->state);

Suppose a TX hard error lands in that window. It stops the queue and the
TX DMA channel, turns the carrier off and sets STMMAC_RESET_REQUESTED,
but no work gets queued. The worker also never re-checks
STMMAC_RESET_REQUESTED.

With the carrier off, dev_watchdog() won't call ndo_tx_timeout either.
Does the channel then stay stopped until an administrative down/up or a
link change?

[Severity: High]
The commit message says:

  "Rebuild retained RX descriptors after reset with buffer addresses and
  chain links written before ownership."

and:

  "Likewise, move resume-time TX cleanup and descriptor rebuilding after
  the reset succeeds."

That rebuild is stmmac_reinit_dma_desc(), which only runs when reinit is
true. No caller in this patch passes true.

A later patch in the series ("net: stmmac: retain DMA resources across
MTU changes") passes it only for MTU rollback. At the end of the series,
stmmac_resume() still does:

    ret = stmmac_hw_setup(ndev, false, false);

So resume takes the STMMAC_DATAPATH_SUSPENDED branch above, which only
calls stmmac_clear_descriptors(). On GMAC4 that goes through
dwmac4_rd_init_rx_desc() -> dwmac4_set_rx_owner(). On XGMAC it goes
through dwxgmac2_init_rx_desc() -> dwxgmac2_set_rx_owner(). Both only OR
flags into des3:

    p->des3 |= cpu_to_le32(flags);

stmmac_suspend() disables NAPI in stmmac_quiesce() before
stmmac_stop_all_dma(). Frames the DMA completes in between stay in
writeback format: des0 holds VLAN tags or zero, and des1/des2 hold
status. Entries whose refill failed (buf->page == NULL) also stay in
writeback format.

After stmmac_start_all_dma() on resume, would the RX DMA take those
writeback words as buffer addresses and write received data there?

[Severity: High]
Can priv->dma_conf still hold all of its allocations while dma_owned is
false, so that this check doesn't catch it? One sequence that seems to
get there:

1. ndo_stop -> __stmmac_release() -> stmmac_drain_dma(): the idle wait
   and stmmac_reset() both fail. Config A stays dma_owned.
   free_dma_desc_resources(A) only calls stmmac_detach_xsk_buffers(), so
   A keeps its descriptors, buf_pool, page_pool and tx_skbuff /
   tx_skbuff_dma arrays. A is not marked retired, because only
   stmmac_put_dma_conf() sets that.

2. ndo_open: stmmac_open() allocates config B. Then
   __stmmac_open(B) -> stmmac_hw_setup() -> stmmac_init_dma_engine()
   resets successfully, and stmmac_dma_reset_complete() sets
   A->dma_owned = false without freeing A.

3. A later step of the open fails, for example stmmac_rxp_config(),
   stmmac_tc_restore_filters(), stmmac_tc_restore_est(),
   stmmac_request_irq() or netif_set_real_num_queues().
   err_dma_resources restores priv->dma_conf = A and frees B.

4. With the interface down, ethtool -G reaches
   stmmac_reinit_ringparam(). stmmac_dma_busy() returns false, and
   A->dma_rx_size and A->dma_tx_size are overwritten.

5. On the next successful open, stmmac_put_dma_conf(A) ->
   free_dma_desc_resources(A) frees A using the new sizes.

If the new sizes are larger, dma_free_rx_skbufs() and
dma_free_tx_skbufs() loop up to the new size. Would they then write
buf->page = NULL and tx_skbuff_dma[i].buf = 0 past the ends of buf_pool
and tx_skbuff_dma, and unmap or free pointers read from beyond them?

Would dma_free_coherent() also be called with a size that doesn't match
the original allocation?

[Severity: Medium]
If an earlier ndo_stop left a config dma_owned, is the stop or reset
ever retried before stmmac_free_dma_conf() quarantines it?

With the datapath already DOWN, __stmmac_release() returns early when
unregister_netdev() calls ndo_stop:

    if (priv->datapath == STMMAC_DATAPATH_DOWN)
        return;

This loop then only calls free_dma_desc_resources(). For owned configs
that is just the software XSK detach; neither stmmac_drain_dma() nor
stmmac_reset() is called.

Further down, stmmac_dvr_remove() asserts the IP reset:

    if (priv->plat->stmmac_rst)
        reset_control_assert(priv->plat->stmmac_rst);

dma_owned is never cleared, though, so the devm action
stmmac_free_dma_conf() skips kfree() for those configs.

After one transient stop/reset timeout followed by an unbind, wouldn't
these leak until reboot?

  - the coherent rings
  - page_pool pages and TX skbs
  - the xsk_dma references, with their UMEM pin and the device and
    netdev references taken by xp_dma_get()

The commit message describes quarantine as happening "If hardware still
cannot stop or reset at removal". Does removal ever actually test that?
