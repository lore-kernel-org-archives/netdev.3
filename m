Sorry, maybe you were not in the CC list of the cover email. From that:

  This collection of patches is aimed at fixing the non-standard ColdFire
  set of readX()/writeX() IO access functions. Instead switching to using the
  asm-generic definitions in include/asm-generic/io.h. The difficulty comes
  in trying not to break any drivers with this change.

  The implementation of the readX()/writeX() family of IO access functions
  is non-standard on ColdFire platforms. They either return big-endian (that
  is native endian) data, or on platforms with PCI bus support check the
  supplied address and return either big or little endian data based on that
  check. This is non-standard, they are expected to always return
  little-endian byte ordered data. Unfortunately this behavior also means
  that ioreadX()/iowroteX() and their big-endian counter parts
  ioreadXbe()/iowriteXbe() are currently broken because they are implemented
  using the readX()/writeX() functions.

  Patches 1 and 2 in this series are specific net driver changes that can be
  applied independently of the final ColdFire readX()/writeX() change.

It is a long standing todo/fix, but there is nothing LLM anywhere here.
This was all manually coded and tested. This patch is 95% textual
substitution, so it wasn't exactly very difficult.

These changes are not work arounds, they are made to make the FEC driver
explicitly aware of endianess of the underlying processor and FEC hardware
block. The code as it is now, that is carrying hacks inside readX and writeX
for m68k, is trying to hide that from the driver.
