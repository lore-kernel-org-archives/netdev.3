selftests: net: packetdrill: add test for negative sk_forward_alloc in tcp_wmem_schedule()

This adds a packetdrill test that drives sk_forward_alloc negative via
tcp_collapse() while sk_wmem_queued exceeds tcp_wmem[0]. It then caps the
socket's memcg and checks that a non-blocking write() fails with EAGAIN
rather than EFAULT. CONFIG_MEMCG=y is also added to the packetdrill config
fragment.

[Severity: Low]
Should this fragment also add CONFIG_CGROUPS=y?

In init/Kconfig, MEMCG sits inside the CGROUPS block:

menuconfig CGROUPS
...
if CGROUPS
...
config MEMCG
	bool "Memory controller"

If this fragment is merged onto a base config with CGROUPS=n,
merge_config only prints a warning and MEMCG is dropped. The new test
then has no memory controller to use.

Other fragments that need memcg, such as
tools/testing/selftests/cgroup/config, list both CONFIG_CGROUPS=y and
CONFIG_MEMCG=y.

[Severity: Medium]
What happens on systems where this check or the cgroup writes below
fail?

The init command runs under set -e. Any of these makes it exit non-zero
and abort packetdrill:

- no cgroup2 mount (hybrid v1 setups, minimal VMs), so the
  [ -n "$cgroot" ] check fails
- the memory controller is bound to cgroup v1, so the +memory write
  gets ENOENT
- the test runs in a container whose cgroup namespace root holds
  processes, so the +memory write gets EBUSY
- cgroupfs is read-only, so the writes and the mkdir fail

ksft_runner.sh treats any non-zero packetdrill exit as a failure:

	&& ktap_test_pass $ip_version || $failfunc $ip_version

Here failfunc=ktap_test_fail. A missing optional feature is therefore
reported as three failures (ipv4, ipv6, ipv4-mapped-ipv6) instead of a
skip. No other packetdrill test depends on cgroups.

Could these prerequisites be detected and reported as a skip?

> +echo +memory > "${cgroot}/cgroup.subtree_control"

[Severity: Low]
Does anything turn the memory controller off at the root again?

The cleanup command at the end of the script moves tasks back and runs
rmdir "${cgroot}/pkt_${PPID}". It never writes -memory. On hosts where
memory was not already enabled in the root cgroup.subtree_control, memcg
accounting stays on for every existing and future top-level cgroup after
the test finishes.

Everything else the test changes is either per-netns or removed
explicitly. This looks like the only setup step with no matching
teardown.

Could the previous state be saved here and restored in cleanup?

> +mkdir -p "${cgroot}/pkt_${PPID}"
> +echo $PPID > "${cgroot}/pkt_${PPID}/cgroup.procs"
> +`

[Severity: Low]
Can a cgroup left over from an earlier run get reused here?

Packetdrill runs the cleanup command itself. If packetdrill is killed by
a signal (a kselftest timeout or SIGKILL), pkt_<pid> stays behind with
the limits set in step 4:

	echo 0 > "${cgroot}/pkt_${PPID}/memory.high"
	cat "${cgroot}/pkt_${PPID}/memory.current" > "${cgroot}/pkt_${PPID}/memory.max"

mkdir -p succeeds on an existing directory, and nothing resets
memory.high or memory.max before packetdrill is moved in. unshare -n
does not create a PID namespace. A later run that gets the same PID
would then do its socket setup and page faults under a near-zero cap.

Would a plain mkdir avoid this? Resetting memory.high and memory.max to
max after creating the directory would also work.

> ++0.000 setsockopt(4, SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVBUF, [145536], 4) = 0

[Severity: Medium]
Does the test rely on these sizes being granted exactly?

sk_setsockopt() in net/core/sock.c clamps both values without reporting
it, and still returns 0:

		val = min_t(u32, val, READ_ONCE(sysctl_wmem_max));
	...
		__sock_set_rcvbuf(sk, min_t(u32, val, READ_ONCE(sysctl_rmem_max)));

net.core.wmem_max and net.core.rmem_max are global and read-only inside
a child netns. The test cannot raise them from its unshare -n
environment.

Suppose the host has lowered net.core.wmem_max, for example to 212992,
which gives an sk_sndbuf of 425984. The blocking
write(4, ..., 500000) in step 2 would then sit in
sk_stream_wait_memory(). Every injected segment carries ack 1, so no
send space is ever freed, and the script never reaches step 4.

Even if it did reach step 4, __sk_mem_raise_allocated() force charges
in this case:

		if (sk->sk_wmem_queued + size >= sk->sk_sndbuf) {
			/* Force charge with __GFP_NOFAIL */

The final write would then succeed instead of returning EAGAIN. A
lowered rmem_max would likewise change the 291072 byte sk_rcvbuf that
the collapse step depends on.

Packetdrill runs privileged. Would SO_SNDBUFFORCE and SO_RCVBUFFORCE, or
a getsockopt() check, make this deterministic?

> ++0.000 write(4, ..., 16384) = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable)

[Severity: Medium]
Is this cap reliable enough for the EAGAIN check?

An earlier comment in the script says:

  // Move packetdrill back to its original cgroup so only the sockets remain charged to pkt_${PPID}

Cgroup v2 does not move existing charges when a task migrates. Whatever
packetdrill allocated while in pkt_${PPID} stays charged there. The same
goes for the sh, awk and sed helpers it forked. Any of those charges can
be released at a later point.

In mm/memcontrol.c, memory_high_write() calls drain_all_stock() once.
drain_all_stock() can skip the drain entirely, and for remote CPUs it
only queues work:

	if (!mutex_trylock(&percpu_charge_mutex))
		return;
	...
			else
				schedule_drain_work(cpu, &memcg_st->work);

memory_max_write() returns straight away, because max equals the
current usage:

		if (nr_pages <= max)
			break;

try_charge_memcg() uses the per-CPU stock before checking any limit:

	if (consume_stock(memcg, nr_pages))
		return 0;

Stock left for pkt_${PPID} on packetdrill's CPU could satisfy the
16384 byte charge. So could a remote drain or an uncharge that completes
after memory.current is read. Either way the charge in
tcp_wmem_schedule()->sk_wmem_schedule()->__sk_mem_raise_allocated()
would succeed and write() would return data. The test would then fail
intermittently with no kernel bug involved.

On systems with swap, can memory.high=0 also swap out packetdrill's own
anon pages that are charged to pkt_${PPID}? Swapping them back in would
charge the capped memcg, which has no task that can be killed.
Packetdrill could then stall in repeated page fault OOM retries.
