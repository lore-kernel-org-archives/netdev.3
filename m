net/smc: don't spin in smc_rx_recvmsg() while a pipe holds spliced data

This patch changes smc_rx_recvmsg() so that, while spliced bytes are still
held in a pipe, recvmsg() checks the timeout and pending signals before it
waits. The wait moves to a new helper, smc_rx_wait_splice(), which ends when
splice_pending drops to zero or the connection is killed, and no longer ends
on RCV_SHUTDOWN. A zero-length read now returns 0 right away.

[Severity: Low]
smc_rx_wait() sets SOCKWQ_ASYNC_WAITDATA around the same kind of sleep:

	sk_set_bit(SOCKWQ_ASYNC_WAITDATA, sk);
	add_wait_queue(sk_sleep(sk), &wait);
	...
	sk_clear_bit(SOCKWQ_ASYNC_WAITDATA, sk);

Should smc_rx_wait_splice() do the same?

The wake callback smc_rx_wake_up() calls
sk_wake_async_rcu(sk, SOCK_WAKE_WAITD, POLL_IN). For SOCK_WAKE_WAITD,
sock_wake_async() sends SIGIO only when SOCKWQ_ASYNC_WAITDATA is clear.

Before this patch, a recvmsg() blocked behind spliced data waited in
smc_rx_wait(..., smc_rx_data_available_and_no_splice_pend), which set the
bit.

Now take an O_ASYNC socket whose F_SETOWN owner is the reader. Each new
peer data arrival during this wait sends SIGIO. The next loop pass sees
splbytes != 0 and signal_pending(current), and returns -EINTR or
-ERESTARTSYS. A reader that used to keep sleeping is now interrupted.

> +	sk_wait_event(sk, timeo, !atomic_read(&conn->splice_pending), &wait);

[Severity: Medium]
Can this wait miss the final wakeup on weakly ordered architectures?

The only waker for this condition is smc_rx_pipe_buf_release(). It
decrements splice_pending and wakes only after release_sock():

net/smc/smc_rx.c:smc_rx_pipe_buf_release() {
    ...
	smc_rx_update_cons(smc, priv->len);
	release_sock(sk);
	if (atomic_sub_and_test(priv->len, &conn->splice_pending))
		smc_rx_wake_up(sk);
    ...
}

smc_rx_wake_up() goes through skwq_has_sleeper(), which does smp_mb() and
then waitqueue_active(). The wq_has_sleeper() comment says this barrier has
to pair with one on the waiting side.

On the reader side, two steps sit between the list store in add_wait_queue()
and the relaxed atomic_read(&conn->splice_pending) in sk_wait_event():

- spin_unlock_irqrestore() on the wait queue lock
- spin_lock_bh()/spin_unlock_bh() on sk_lock.slock inside release_sock()

Neither is a full barrier. Under LKMM, an unlock and a lock on different
locks don't order an earlier store before a later load. That leaves a
store-buffering pattern:

reader                                releaser
add_wait_queue()
  (store not yet visible)
                                      atomic_sub_and_test() -> 0
                                      smp_mb()
                                      waitqueue_active() -> false
atomic_read(&conn->splice_pending)
  -> stale N
wait_woken() sleeps

Before this patch, the RCV_SHUTDOWN, peer close and abort states spun here,
so they could not lose a wakeup. They now sleep in smc_rx_wait_splice() and
depend on this single wakeup.

Once the peer has shut down or closed, no more CDC traffic wakes
sk_sleep(). A blocking recvmsg() without SO_RCVTIMEO could then sleep until
a signal arrives, even though the data is already in the RMB. On x86 and
s390 the lock acquire is a full barrier, so this would only show up on
architectures like powerpc.

The notes below the --- line already say "Under LKMM, today's order allows a
lost wake even with the condition". The old smc_rx_wait() has the same gap,
but this patch newly relies on it for the shutdown and abort states.

Would an smp_mb() between add_wait_queue() and the condition read close
this? Moving the splice_pending decrement and the wakeup under lock_sock()
in smc_rx_pipe_buf_release() looks like another option.

[Severity: Medium]
This is a pre-existing issue that this patch didn't introduce: can the
splice path read a stale splbytes here?

smc_rx_pipe_buf_release() moves the consumer cursor under lock_sock(), but
it decrements splice_pending only after release_sock() (see the snippet
above).

The releasing pipe's mutex doesn't serialize a concurrent smc_splice_read()
into a different pipe. In that window, the second splice can take
lock_sock(), reach copy:, and read splbytes == N here. It then adds N to a
cons that has already moved by N:

	smc_curs_copy(&cons, &conn->local_tx_ctrl.cons, conn);
	...
	if (splbytes)
		smc_curs_add(conn->rmb_desc->len, &cons, splbytes);

That skips N bytes of valid stream data. It also splices N bytes from past
the producer cursor into the second pipe.

smcr_buf_unuse() and smc_buf_unuse() zero the RMBs. So this corrupts only
the connection's own stream and doesn't expose another connection's data.
The accesses stay inside the RMB.

The notes below the --- line say a separate series moves the splice_pending
decrement under lock_sock(). That looks like it would also close this
window for the msg == NULL path.

[Severity: Medium]
This is a pre-existing issue rather than one added by this patch, but
smc_poll() still disagrees with this -EAGAIN:

net/smc/af_smc.c:smc_poll() {
    ...
			if (atomic_read(&smc->conn.bytes_to_rcv))
				mask |= EPOLLIN | EPOLLRDNORM;
			if (sk->sk_shutdown & RCV_SHUTDOWN)
				mask |= EPOLLIN | EPOLLRDNORM | EPOLLRDHUP;
    ...
}

bytes_to_rcv doesn't count spliced bytes, because smc_rx_recvmsg()
subtracts copylen for them too. Suppose a pipe holds N bytes and the peer
has sent M more behind them. Then bytes_to_rcv == M.

poll(), select() and level-triggered epoll keep reporting EPOLLIN. Meanwhile
every recv(MSG_DONTWAIT), and every recv() on an O_NONBLOCK socket, returns
-EAGAIN from this branch. An event-loop reader would busy-loop in userspace
until the pipe is drained.

Before this patch the same non-blocking recv() spun inside the kernel, so
CPU use is no worse than before. The commit message doesn't mention that
this case remains, though. Should smc_poll() also look at
conn->splice_pending?
