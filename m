PF0's release is only queued (schedule_detach() -> detach_memdev()). Until that work runs, PF0 is bound, the memdev is found, hpa_range is valid, and attach->cxlr points at a freed region. Root teardown (kill_regions()) and delete_region also unregister the region without touching PF0.

One thing I tried to discuss with Dan was why we have the unbinding options for cxl_mem and cxl_port drivers. What is the point? I know this is standard linux device model, but the unbinding could do nothing if we decide so. Couldn't we? Otherwise, If there is a good reason for having this functionality where the unwinding can happen through different starting points, we should document it.

You need a region-side teardown clearing attach->cxlr under the cxl_rwsem.region before unregistering. And readers need to check under the same lock. The endpoint_detach_attach_region() proposal does close that hole.

Moreover, some user actions on things created by a Type2 driver should not be so easy accessed, and definitely, having a region unregistered and released with its main consumer and owner completely unaware, should not be happening.

We contemplated memdev unbinding and that is supported, and acpi module removal as well (all the unwinding is hopefully right for sfc driver removal), but the fact is, current Type2 support is unsound. It is likely good enough with current usage expectations but something to improve/fix.

Removing the acpi module will also cause the issue I pointed out. So that isn't safe either. The only path that's good right now is sfc driver removal or the device going away.

I did ask Dan about it, and I was expecting use cases where HDM decoders and regions are dynamically created, which makes a lot of sense to me, but the fact is all is relying on firmware/BIOS configuration. Richard is working on adding this functionality for Type2 and pmems, and Jonathan considers it theoretically useful as well, but the way is going to be handled requires, IMO, further thinking and maybe a change before someone starts using it (does anyone know about users now?).

Shouldn't does not mean does not exist. Sure I can agree with you that under normal operations, certain things a sane user should avoid doing for type2. But it is possible currently and those issues can be triggered. However you feel about the current CXL architecture, here we are with where it is. You can either consider the smaller changes I suggested to keep the attach->cxlr sane (or with some other means) and make what you need working now with raised the issue addressed, and come back with hashing out the larger grievances later, or keep beating this horse.... "It's silly for users to do that and therefore the issue can be ignored" is not a good enough reason for me look the other way and merge the code.
