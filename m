First, we should remember that implementing hardware-bound keys via a
standalone crypto engine is a dated approach.  Inline crypto engines and
CPUs, which work much better than and are much easier to use than legacy
standalone crypto engines, can support hardware-bound keys as well.  The
former is already supported, and is already being widely used, in the
kernel via the hardware-wrapped inline crypto keys feature.  For the
latter, see e.g. RISC-V High Assurance Cryptography.  In the CPU case no
UAPI is even needed; userspace can just use it directly.

But with that being said, yes, there are a few in-tree drivers that
register "paes" algorithms with the crypto_skcipher or crypto_aead APIs,
or "phmac" with crypto_ahash.  That made them accessible via AF_ALG.

Of course, no use of these via AF_ALG has actually been confirmed yet.
Note that any such use would be unrelated to any use via dm-crypt or
dm-integrity, as those features call the kernel's crypto code directly.

But if any are confirmed and we end up needing to allowlist any of these
specific hardware-bound key algorithms in AF_ALG for compatibility
reasons, we can do that.  That does not mean we should allowlist
out-of-tree algorithms, or asynchronous algorithms in general.

We should also remember that AF_ALG has never actually supported
creating hardware-bound keys.  Anyone using it actually needs to use a
different UAPI to create the key.  This is driver-specific.  For CAAM it
seems to involve keyctl() calls, whereas for s390 it's /dev/pkey.  Any
userspace program that (theoretically) would be using either one has to
know which type of hardware it's talking to anyway.

So with this being a dated approach and also driver-specific anyway, and
with at least one driver using a char device already, I think the
replacement here (if any is needed for the few standalone crypto engine
drivers that implement this) would just be a driver-specific char device
with the minimum functionality required.  We shouldn't overthink things.
