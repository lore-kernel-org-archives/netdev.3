netlink: specs: add genetlink-legacy spec for GTP

This commit adds a genetlink-legacy YAML spec for the existing GTP generic
netlink family. The spec covers the NEWPDP, DELPDP, GETPDP and ECHOREQ
commands, the GTPA_* attribute set and the "gtp" multicast group. It also
adds the new spec file to the GTP entry in MAINTAINERS.

[Severity: Low]
This spec has no version property, so the genetlink-legacy schema default
of 1 applies. The kernel registers the family with version 0:

drivers/net/gtp.c:
static struct genl_family gtp_genl_family __ro_after_init = {
	.name		= "gtp",
	.version	= 0,

The schema in Documentation/netlink/genetlink-legacy.yaml also says
"minimum: 1". That means the spec can't state the real value unless the
schema is relaxed.

The runtime effect seems limited. Both the C and Python ynl code hard-code
version 1 in requests, and the kernel does not check the request version.
The remaining problem is wrong metadata, such as a GTP_FAMILY_VERSION of 1
if uapi or kernel code were ever generated from this spec.

Should the spec record version 0, with the schema relaxed to allow it?

[Severity: Low]
Does exact-len match the kernel policy? gtp_genl_policy has:

	[GTPA_PEER_ADDR6]	= { .len = sizeof(struct in6_addr), },
	[GTPA_MS_ADDR6]		= { .len = sizeof(struct in6_addr), },

These entries have no type, so they are NLA_UNSPEC, and .len is only a
minimum length. Every gtp op sets GENL_DONT_VALIDATE_STRICT, so the kernel
accepts attributes longer than 16 bytes. The spec describes those as
invalid.

Should this be min-len: 16 here and for ms-addr6? Alternatively, the
policy could switch to NLA_POLICY_EXACT_LEN.

[Severity: Low]
This reuses the full newpdp attribute list. The delete path is
gtp_genl_del_pdp()->gtp_find_pdp()->gtp_find_pdp_by_link()/gtp_find_dev(),
and it only reads link, net-ns-fd, family, ms-address, ms-addr6, version,
tid and i-tei.

peer-address, peer-addr6, flow and o-tei are ignored, but ynl will still
generate setters for them.

Would the lookup-only list used by the getpdp request be a better fit for
delpdp?

[Severity: Medium]
Should link be part of this reply list? gtp_genl_fill_info() always emits
it:

	if (nla_put_u32(skb, GTPA_VERSION, pctx->gtp_version) ||
	    nla_put_u32(skb, GTPA_LINK, pctx->dev->ifindex) ||
	    nla_put_u8(skb, GTPA_FAMILY, pctx->af))

The C parser generated by ynl_gen_c only decodes the listed reply
attributes. That means link is dropped from getpdp do replies, from dump
entries and from NEWPDP/DELPDP notifications.

A dump walks every gtp device in the netns. A generated C client therefore
can't tell which device a context belongs to. It also can't build the
matching delpdp or getpdp request, because gtp_find_pdp() needs GTPA_LINK.

The Python ynl used by selftests decodes against the whole attribute set,
so it would not catch this.

> +            - peer-addr6
> +            - family

[Severity: Medium]
Can a generated client ever get a successful echoreq with this list?
gtp_genl_send_echo_req() requires ms-address and uses it as the source
address:

	if (!info->attrs[GTPA_VERSION] ||
	    !info->attrs[GTPA_LINK] ||
	    !info->attrs[GTPA_PEER_ADDRESS] ||
	    !info->attrs[GTPA_MS_ADDRESS])
		return -EINVAL;
	...
	src_ip = nla_get_be32(info->attrs[GTPA_MS_ADDRESS]);

ynl_gen_c builds the request struct only from the op's listed attributes,
in RenderInfo:

	type_list = op[op_mode][op_dir]['attributes']

So the generated C echoreq request has no way to set ms-address, and
every call returns -EINVAL.

The handler looks up the device through gtp_find_dev(), which reads
GTPA_NET_NS_FD when it is present. net-ns-fd isn't listed either, so a
gtp device in another netns can't be targeted.

peer-addr6 and family are listed, but the handler never reads them because
echo requests are IPv4 only. A request with only an IPv6 peer in
peer-addr6 would still get -EINVAL.

Should this list be link, version, peer-address, ms-address and net-ns-fd?

> +      name: gtp

[Severity: Medium]
The gtp group is declared, but no operation has a notify or event entry
that describes what the kernel sends on it. The kernel multicasts three
kinds of message on GTP_GENL_MCGRP:

- GTP_CMD_NEWPDP from gtp_genl_new_pdp() via gtp_tunnel_notify()
- GTP_CMD_DELPDP from gtp_genl_del_pdp() via gtp_tunnel_notify(), both
  carrying the gtp_genl_fill_info() contents
- GTP_CMD_ECHOREQ when an echo response arrives, from
  gtp0_handle_echo_resp() and its GTPv1-U counterpart

The echo response case looks like this:

	ret = gtp_genl_fill_echo(msg, 0, 0, 0, GTP_CMD_ECHOREQ, echo);
	...
	return genlmsg_multicast_netns(&gtp_genl_family, dev_net(gtp->dev),
				       msg, 0, GTP_GENL_MCGRP, GFP_ATOMIC);

In tools/net/ynl/pyynl/lib/nlspec.py, SpecOperation marks an op as async
only when 'notify' or 'event' is present. YnlFamily.check_ntf() drops
everything else:

    if decoded.cmd() not in self.async_msg_ids:
        print("Unexpected msg id while checking for ntf", decoded)
        continue

A ynl client subscribed to gtp would throw away every notification. That
includes the echo response report, which is the only way to get the
result of an echoreq. ynl_gen_c also generates no notification parsers
for this family.

The notifications reuse the request command IDs, so describing them may
need explicit values or a schema change. Should the spec describe these
messages in some form?

[Severity: Low]
Is a tools/net/ynl/Makefile.deps entry needed for this new spec?
tools/net/ynl/generated/Makefile builds every spec under
Documentation/netlink/specs except those in GENS_UNSUP, so gtp-user.c is
now generated and compiled.

The generated code includes <linux/gtp.h>. The in-tree uapi directory is
only added with -idirafter, so the host's installed header is found first.
Hosts with older headers lack GTPA_PEER_ADDR6, GTPA_MS_ADDR6 and
GTPA_FAMILY, and very old ones also lack GTP_CMD_ECHOREQ. The ynl build
would fail on those hosts.

Other families handle this with an entry like:

CFLAGS_ovpn:=$(call get_hdr_inc,_LINUX_OVPN_H,ovpn.h)
CFLAGS_psp:=$(call get_hdr_inc,_LINUX_PSP_H,psp.h)

Would something like this be needed for gtp?

CFLAGS_gtp:=$(call get_hdr_inc,_LINUX_GTP_H_,gtp.h)
