From: Sharath Srinivasan <sharath.srinivasan@oracle.com>

Since connection free became asynchronous, rds_conn_destroy() only
quiesces the connection; the actual free - including the transport's
conn_free, which lives in the transport module - runs when the last
reference is dropped.  The transports' exit paths destroy all of
their connections and then proceed to unload, so a free that is still
pending - once the following patches hand out references to lookups,
sockets and incs - would execute transport module code after that
module's text is gone.  At this point in the series the initial
reference is the only one, so the wait only has work to do for IB,
where it also catches the late arrivals described below; the
guarantee becomes load-bearing with those patches.

Count each transport's live connections in t_conn_count (incremented
when a connection is published in __rds_conn_create(), decremented as
the last step of rds_conn_destroy_fini()) and make the transport exit
paths - rds_ib_exit(), rds_tcp_exit() and rds_loop_exit() - wait for
the count to drop to zero after destroying their connections.

A bound socket holds a module reference on its own transport
(rds_trans_get_preferred()), but that does not bound the wait: once
the following patches make incs hold a connection reference, an
unread datagram pins its connection for as long as the application
leaves it on the receive queue, and rds_find_bound() does not filter
on transport, so that socket may well belong to a different transport
than the connection and pin nothing that stops this unload.
Proceeding after a timeout would turn a leak into a use-after-free in
this module's text, so the wait is unbounded: it polls the count,
warns every ten seconds naming the transport and the number of
connections outstanding, and returns only when the count reaches
zero.  rmmod therefore blocks while data is queued and unread, which
is the historical RDS contract - teardown does not discard queued
data.
The wait is deliberately not interruptible: the exit function has
already passed the point of no return, and a killed rmmod would leave
the module half torn down and unloadable, which is worse than a
blocked one.  The polling wakes every 100 ms, so the hung task detector
does not fire.

The wake at the end of rds_conn_destroy_fini() can run from a thread
executing transport module text, but never as that thread's last use
of it: the CM event handler's reference (added later in the series) is
always dropped before the rdma_destroy_id() in the connection's own
shutdown returns, and rds_rdma_exit() stops the listener - waiting for
any handler running on it - before rds_ib_exit() starts to wait.

rds_ib_exit() has one more wrinkle, and an existing hole.
rds_ib_dev_shutdown() only drops the connections still attached to a
device, and each of them moves itself to ib_nodev_conns from its own
shutdown work, asynchronously; the flush_workqueue(rds_wq) in
rds_ib_unregister_client() does not wait for those per-connection
workqueues.  A connection that had not migrated by the time
rds_ib_destroy_nodev_conns() made its single sweep was never
destroyed: it outlived the module, still pointing at
rds_ib_transport.  With the count, it would hold the count up for
good instead.  So the wait takes a resweep callback, which
rds_ib_exit() points at rds_ib_destroy_nodev_conns(): late arrivals
get destroyed on the next poll instead of being waited on.  The sweep
claims and unlinks every node it gathers (see the previous patch), so
a resweep never hands a connection to rds_conn_destroy() twice.

In rds_ib_exit(), tearing down the last connection can also drop the
final reference on a device, which defers rds_ib_dev_free() - again
this module's text - to rds_wq.  The flush of rds_wq that the device
gate patch added after the sweep moves after the wait, so that it
covers the connections the resweep destroys as well; rds_ib_dev_free()
queues nothing further on rds_wq, so a single pass drains it.

Based on the Oracle UEK commits "net/rds: wait_event_timeout
until zero connections during rmmod" and "net/rds:
Each RDS transport should keep its own connection count".

[achender: reimplementation for net-next: t_conn_count did not exist
 upstream and is introduced here; single global waitqueue instead of
 per-transport (the loop transport never goes through
 rds_trans_register()); unbounded wait with a periodic warning in
 place of UEK's wait_event_timeout() + WARN_ON(), plus the resweep for
 IB's asynchronous device detach; also cover rds_loop_exit(); rewrite
