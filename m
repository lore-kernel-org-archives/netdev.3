net/smc: bound the send length to the send buffer in smc_tx_sendmsg()

The patch clamps writespace in smc_tx_sendmsg() to sndbuf_desc->len. It
also maps negative values to len. This keeps the copy inside the send
buffer when conn->sndbuf_space has been over-credited, either after an
SMC-R link failover or through the SMC-D DMB merge path.

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but the new comment says sndbuf_space can be out of
range. A few lines further down in the same loop, the existing comment
still says the opposite:

net/smc/smc_tx.c:smc_tx_sendmsg() {
    ...
	atomic_sub(copylen, &conn->sndbuf_space);
	/* guarantee 0 <= sndbuf_space <= sndbuf_desc->len */
	smp_mb__after_atomic();
    ...
}

The same "guarantee" comment also appears in the credit paths that the
new comment names: smc_cdc_tx_handler(), smcd_cdc_msg_send() and the DMB
merge branch of smc_cdc_msg_recv_action().

The clamped subtraction doesn't bring the value back into that range. If
sndbuf_space starts at 3 * len, subtracting copylen <= len leaves at
least 2 * len. A negative value is mapped to len and then pushed further
below zero.

Should those comments be updated or dropped so they don't contradict the
new one?

[Severity: High]
Mapping a negative writespace to sndbuf_desc->len is new behaviour from
this patch. It turns a negative sndbuf_space into a full-ring copy on
every pass of the loop. Is that intended?

The gate at the top of the loop treats only zero as no space:

	if (!atomic_read(&conn->sndbuf_space) || conn->urg_tx_pend) {

A negative sndbuf_space is non-zero, so it skips smc_tx_wait()
entirely. The new check then sets writespace to sndbuf_desc->len, so
copylen can be a whole ring.

memcpy_from_msg() writes that at tx_curs_prep. It overwrites whatever
is still unsent in [tx_curs_sent, tx_curs_prep), and whatever is still
unconfirmed in [tx_curs_fin, tx_curs_sent) that an in-flight RDMA write
may still be reading.

The atomic_sub(copylen, &conn->sndbuf_space) afterwards pushes the
value further below zero. This path can therefore never bring it back
to zero. The loop keeps copying until the whole message is consumed,
with no back-pressure. That lasts until CDC completions happen to
credit sndbuf_space back above zero.

smc_tx_wait(), smc_tx_should_cork() and smc_poll() use the same
non-zero test. While the space is negative, a blocked writer would be
woken, corking would still apply, and a poller would see EPOLLOUT.

The note below the --- line says 0 was avoided because the send loop
would spin. That is true with the current !atomic_read() gate. Would it
be better to make the gate treat sndbuf_space <= 0 as no space, along
with the matching checks in smc_tx_wait(), smc_tx_should_cork() and
smc_poll()? A negative value would then block the sender instead of
letting it overwrite data the peer has not received.

Before this patch a negative value caused an out-of-bounds write. With
it, the result is silent stream corruption that sendmsg() reports as
success.

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, and this patch didn't introduce it. The
clamp limits the size of each copy but doesn't fix the flow control.
While sndbuf_space is over-credited, can smc_tx_sendmsg() still overwrite
data in the send buffer that hasn't been sent or confirmed yet?

The wait check at the top of the loop counts any non-zero value as free
space:

	if (!atomic_read(&conn->sndbuf_space) || conn->urg_tx_pend) {

smc_tx_wait(), smc_tx_should_cork() and smc_poll() make the same check.
Each pass then copies up to sndbuf_desc->len bytes at tx_curs_prep and
subtracts only copylen. A value of 3 * len stays positive for two more
passes. A negative value never reaches zero.

That lets tx_curs_prep run more than a full ring past tx_curs_sent and
tx_curs_fin. The copy then overwrites unsent bytes in
[tx_curs_sent, tx_curs_prep), plus bytes in [tx_curs_fin, tx_curs_sent)
that in-flight RDMA writes may still be reading.

smc_tx_rdma_writes() then computes:

	to_send = smc_curs_diff(conn->sndbuf_desc->len, &sent, &prep);

That value is now larger than len, so the overwritten ring contents get
sent. sendmsg() reports success, but the peer receives a corrupted
stream.

One trigger is a peer DELETE LINK while the old QP still works:

smc_llc_process_cli_delete_link()
  smc_switch_conns(lgr, lnk_del, false)

A CDC completion still pending on the old link is later handled by
smc_wr_tx_process_cqe()->smc_cdc_tx_handler() with a stale
cdcpend->cursor. If tx_curs_fin is one wrap ahead, smc_curs_diff()
returns nearly 2 * len and tx_curs_fin moves back. The next completion
then credits the same bytes again.

If corking with MSG_MORE or a full peer RMBE keeps tx_curs_sent from
moving between passes, the overwrite is guaranteed.

The note below the --- line already says that "send() can still
overwrite data in the buffer that the peer has not received yet". Before
this patch, the same over-credit caused an out-of-bounds write instead.
Is a fix for the credit in smc_cdc_tx_handler() planned as a follow-up?

[Severity: High]
This is also a pre-existing issue. What serializes smc_switch_cursor()
against smc_cdc_tx_handler()?

smc_switch_conns() holds only conn->send_lock around the switch:

	spin_lock_bh(&conn->send_lock);
	smc_switch_link_and_count(conn, to_lnk);
	rc = smc_switch_cursor(smc, pend, wr_buf);
	spin_unlock_bh(&conn->send_lock);

smc_switch_cursor() rewrites tx_curs_sent, tx_curs_fin,
local_tx_ctrl.prod and local_tx_ctrl_fin, and it adds to sndbuf_space.

smc_cdc_tx_handler() runs from the send CQ tasklet. It does a non-atomic
read, diff, add and copy while holding only bh_lock_sock():

	bh_lock_sock(&smc->sk);
	if (!wc_status && sndbuf_desc) {
		diff = smc_curs_diff(sndbuf_desc->len,
				     &cdcpend->conn->tx_curs_fin,
				     &cdcpend->cursor);
		...
		atomic_add(diff, &cdcpend->conn->sndbuf_space);
		...
		smc_curs_copy(&conn->tx_curs_fin, &cdcpend->cursor, conn);

Neither path takes the other's lock, and the tasklet can run on another
CPU in the middle of the switch. One possible interleaving:

CPU1 (smc_switch_cursor)
  smc_curs_copy(&conn->tx_curs_sent, &conn->tx_curs_fin, conn);
  smc_curs_copy(&fin, &conn->local_tx_ctrl_fin, conn);

CPU2 (smc_cdc_tx_handler)
  atomic_add(diff, &cdcpend->conn->sndbuf_space);
  smc_curs_copy(&conn->tx_curs_fin, &cdcpend->cursor, conn);

CPU1 (smc_switch_cursor, diff computed from the older fin)
  smc_curs_add(conn->sndbuf_desc->len, &conn->tx_curs_fin, diff);
  atomic_add(diff, &conn->sndbuf_space);

Does this credit the same bytes twice and leave tx_curs_fin ahead of
tx_curs_sent?

The patch bounds only the local writespace snapshot. The shared
sndbuf_space would stay inflated, so smc_tx_sendmsg() could still
overwrite unsent data. On SMC-R an RDMA write may still be using that
data. With SMC-D nocopy, the peer may still be reading it from its DMB.
