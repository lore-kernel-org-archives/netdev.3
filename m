net: phylink: allow stopping a suspended instance

This patch lets phylink_stop() shut down an instance that is still
suspended after a driver resume failed, without going through
phylink_resume(). When the instance is already stopped, it no longer
repeats PHY/SFP/PCS shutdown. It also completes the link-down that MAC WoL
deferred, and it tracks and undoes the PHY speed-down done at suspend time.

> Fixes: f97493657c63 ("net: phylink: add suspend/resume support")

[Severity: Low]
Is this Fixes: tag complete? Several of the things this patch fixes were
added after f97493657c63.

phylink_phy_pm_speed_ctrl() and the phylink_speed_down() call in
phylink_suspend() came from dc1a2a9ce5b2c8. The new suspend_speed_down
tracking and phylink_restore_suspend_speed() fix that commit.

The new MAC WoL block in phylink_stop() depends on suspend_link_up
handling, which came from 4c8925cb9db158.

The commit message gives phylink_prepare_resume() as the reason for the
new phy_suspend() call, and phylink_prepare_resume() came from
367f1854d442b3.

Should there be at least one more Fixes: tag, for dc1a2a9ce5b2c8? With
only f97493657c63, stable tooling may try to backport this to trees that
lack the state and functions the patch modifies.

[Severity: Medium]
Is PHYLINK_DISABLE_STOPPED specific enough to identify a suspended
instance? phylink_create() also sets it:

drivers/net/phy/phylink.c:phylink_create() {
    ...
	__set_bit(PHYLINK_DISABLE_STOPPED, &pl->phylink_disable_state);
    ...
}

Every completed phylink_stop() also leaves it set. So this branch also
runs for an instance that was never started and for a second, unbalanced
phylink_stop(). In both cases it calls phy_suspend() without any warning.

Before this patch, a second phylink_stop() reached phy_stop() with the PHY
in PHY_HALTED, which hit:

	WARN(1, "called from state %s\n", phy_state_to_str(phydev->state));

Is it intended that phylink users lose this warning for unbalanced
start/stop?

The new kernel-doc says the PHY is suspended again only "If
phylink_prepare_resume() powered up an already stopped PHY". The code does
it for any stopped instance whose PHY is not suspended. That includes a
PHY powered up by phy_attach_direct() on an instance that was never
started.

A later patch in this series ("net: stmmac: track datapath and power
ownership across failed reopening") already relies on this broader
behaviour. Its __stmmac_open() calls phylink_stop() twice on an instance
that phylink_start() never started.

Should the commit message and kernel-doc describe this wider contract?

The early return also skips the new MAC WoL cleanup further down. If
phylink_suspend(pl, true) runs on an instance that is already stopped,
both bits end up set:

phylink_suspend(pl, true)
    __set_bit(PHYLINK_DISABLE_MAC_WOL, ...)
phylink_stop(pl)
    STOPPED already set -> phy_suspend(); return;
phylink_start(pl)
    phylink_enable_and_run_resolve(pl, PHYLINK_DISABLE_STOPPED)
        MAC_WOL is still set, so the resolver never runs

Can the link still come up after that phylink_start()? At this commit,
stmmac seems able to reach this sequence:

  - an MTU change reopen fails, leaving the interface up with phylink
    stopped
  - a MAC WoL system suspend
  - a failed resume
  - close, then open

[Severity: Medium]
Does this still complete the deferred link-down if phylink_suspend() was
called twice with no phylink_resume() in between?

phylink_suspend() recomputes the flag on every MAC WoL suspend:

drivers/net/phy/phylink.c:phylink_suspend() {
    ...
		pl->suspend_link_up = phylink_link_is_up(pl);
		if (pl->suspend_link_up) {
			...
			if (pl->netdev)
				netif_carrier_off(pl->netdev);
			pl->old_link_state = false;
		}
    ...
}

The first suspend turns the carrier off and clears old_link_state, but
does not call mac_link_down(). While PHYLINK_DISABLE_MAC_WOL is set, the
resolver cannot turn the carrier back on.

Now suppose resume fails before phylink_resume() and the device stays
running. The next system suspend calls phylink_suspend(pl, true) again.

stmmac_suspend() at this commit does this, because it only checks
netif_running(). ucc_geth_suspend() does it after ucc_geth_init_mac()
fails in ucc_geth_resume().

That second call sets suspend_link_up to false, although mac_link_down()
has still not been called.

A later close reaches this block and skips phylink_link_down(), so neither
mac_link_down() nor phylink_deactivate_lpi() runs. PHYLINK_DISABLE_MAC_WOL
is still cleared.

Wouldn't that leave the earlier mac_link_up() without a matching
mac_link_down(), with pl->mac_enable_tx_lpi still true? The next
phylink_start() could then call mac_link_up() again with no link-down in
between.
