- [Medium] At this commit, the jumbo MTU set by a multi-buffer case

selftests: xsk: run one test case per xskxceiver invocation

This commit moves the mode x case matrix from xskxceiver into test_xsk.sh.
xskxceiver now requires -m and -t and runs a single case per process. An
unsupported mode now becomes a skip instead of XFAIL, and test_xsk.sh
prints a summary of passed, skipped and failed cases.

[Severity: Low]
Should the option descriptions in print_usage() change along with the
usage line? The rest of the text still says:

    "  -m, --mode           Run only mode skb, drv, or zc\n"
    ...
    "  -t, --test           Run a specific test. Enter number from -l option.\n"

That presents -m and -t as optional filters. However, parse_command_line()
now refuses to run unless both are given:

    if (opt_run_test == RUN_ALL_TESTS || opt_mode == TEST_MODE_ALL)
        print_usage(argv);

Users also see this text from ./test_xsk.sh -h, because the help branch
there runs ./${XSKOBJ} with no arguments. After this patch, test_xsk.sh
rejects -m zc with "Unsupported veth mode: zc (expected skb or drv)". It
also accepts test names for -t, and it does not take the -i TX_IFACE -i
RX_IFACE arguments that the new usage line shows.

The mismatch is still there at the end of the series, where the usage
line becomes "-i IFACE -e rx|tx -m MODE -t TEST -p HOST -P PORT".

[Severity: Medium]
Can a multi-buffer case leave the veth pair at the jumbo MTU and cause
every later drv case to skip here?

For multi-buffer cases, __testapp_validate_traffic() calls
test_spec_set_mtu(test, test->mtu), which sets the jumbo MTU on both
veths. At this commit nothing restores it before the process exits.
cleanup_iface() only resets HW rings, detaches XDP and unloads the
skeleton.

The next case runs in a new process. It calls
detect_mode_caps()->is_xdp_supported(), which attaches a native program
without frags support, and veth_xdp_set() refuses it:

drivers/net/veth.c:veth_xdp_set() {
    ...
		if (peer->mtu > max_mtu) {
			NL_SET_ERR_MSG_MOD(extack, "Peer MTU is too large to set XDP");
			err = -ERANGE;
			goto err;
		}
    ...
}

As a result, mode_supported(TEST_MODE_DRV, caps) returns false and the case
is reported as a skip. The MTU is still not put back, so the remaining drv
cases in that pass would skip as well, and test_xsk.sh still exits 0.

The later patch "selftests: xsk: add a hardware mode to xskxceiver" in this
series seems to fix this. It tracks dev_mtu/orig_mtu and restores the MTU
in cleanup_iface(), so only the intermediate commits are affected. Could
the MTU restore be moved into this patch so the series stays bisectable?

[Severity: Medium]
The commit message says:

  "so that every case starts from a fresh process and a case that crashes
  fails only itself"

Is that true when a crashed skb case is followed by drv cases on the same
veth pair?

In an skb case, xsk_reattach_xdp()->xsk_attach_xdp_program() attaches the
program with bpf_xdp_attach(..., XDP_FLAGS_SKB_MODE, NULL). That is a
netdev attachment, not a bpf_link, so it outlives the process. If the case
dies abnormally, for example from a signal or an assert() in test_xsk.c,
main() never reaches cleanup_iface() and the generic program stays on
VETH0.

The next drv case then fails its probe in
main()->detect_mode_caps()->is_xdp_supported(). dev_xdp_attach() refuses
native mode while a generic program is attached:

net/core/dev.c:dev_xdp_attach() {
    ...
		if (!offload && dev_xdp_prog(dev, other_mode)) {
			NL_SET_ERR_MSG(extack, "Native and generic XDP can't be active at the same time");
			return -EEXIST;
		}
    ...
}

DRV is then reported as unsupported and the case becomes TEST_SKIP.
cleanup_iface() does not detach anything, because ifobj->xdp_prog is NULL
in the new process:

    if (ifobj->xdp_prog)
        xsk_detach_xdp_program(...);

run_matrix() runs all skb cases before all drv cases, and the veths are
only recreated between the SOFTIRQ and BUSY_POLL passes. Wouldn't a crash
in the last skb case turn the whole drv pass into skips? With a single -t
selection, the next case is always the one affected.

Later skb cases do recover, because xsk_reattach_xdp() detaches in skb
mode first. The problem is still there at the end of the series: the TX
endpoint's probe fails on VETH0 and it skips while its RX peer goes ahead.

Should leftover XDP programs be detached from the veths before each case?

[Severity: Low]
What exit status should the script return when every selected case skips?
Skips are counted, but only failures change the exit code. A run where
nothing passed therefore exits 0, and the kselftest runner reports PASS
instead of SKIP.

For example, ./test_xsk.sh -m skb -t XDP_ADJUST_TAIL_GROW skips in both
passes, because testapp_adjust_tail_grow() returns early:

    if (test->mode == TEST_MODE_SKB)
        return TEST_SKIP;

The summary shows zero passed and two skipped, but the script exits 0.

This patch also changes an unsupported mode in main() from
ksft_exit_xfail() to a per-case skip. So a -m drv run whose DRV probe fails
used to fail, and now reports success.

Could the script exit with $ksft_skip when passes is 0 and skips is
non-zero?
