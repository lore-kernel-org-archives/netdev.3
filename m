I believe the understanding is that basic functional testing occurs
before the RC cycle.  Considering the NULL check causing problems for
your use case was present in your first RFC posting back in February,
it's unlikely that you, or anyone in the BPF LSM space, tested this
prior to the merge window.

The LSM changes in this patchset do change the behavior, that's the
point.  The security_namespace_free() hook does not call into the
individual LSM callbacks if no LSM blobs have been requested; what you
are proposing now is that we change the hook so that the callback is
always called, regardless of the LSM blob state.

... which you sent *after* the merge window opened.  Once again, I see
no indication that the use case you are concerned about was ever
tested prior to the merge window.

It's a one line change in kernel/bpf/bpf_lsm.c to add the
security_namespace_free() to the existing list of disabled BPF LSM
callbacks.  No need for a patchset spanning 16 files and over 350
lines of changes; the BPF LSM callback can be enabled in Linux v7.5
after it has been properly tested.

It is probably also worth mentioning again to casual observers that
the LSM hooks, and their associated callbacks, are intentionally not a
stable API.  LSMs are advised to implement abstractions before
exposing the hook/callback API directly to user-visible interfaces
such as configuration policy, policy as code, etc.

Are we really going to argue about how one defines "serious problems"
and "panics"?  You'll notice that I've used "serious problems" and
"panic" somewhat loosely in this email thread because the distinction
doesn't really apply to our discussion.  The issue you've brought up
is that a use case that was never tested prior to the merge window
doesn't work like you want it to work.  There is no kernel panic nor
any functional regression from previous kernel releases (user visible
or otherwise).  We'll change how the security_namespace_free() LSM
hook works for the next release which should give you plenty of time
to test that it works properly.

> A hook that is

> problem for an API.

I'll repeat myself again, a little louder for those in the back: the
LSM hooks and callbacks are not a stable API, if an individual LSM
needs a stable API to expose to userspace it needs to provide its own
abstraction layer.

There is an important difference between those issues and the one
you've identified with this patchset: lsm_get_self_attr() and
lsm_set_self_attr() are syscalls while security_namespace_free() is a
LSM hook.  Linux syscalls are subject to the Linux kernel stable API,
LSM hooks are not.  Linux syscalls are directly accessible from
userspace, LSM hooks are not.  We could dive into other minutiae about
the differences between those issues, but the distinction between
syscalls and LSM hooks is really the only one that should matter here.

 :D

Instead you're asking someone else to accept your changes in a
subsystem you don't maintain and when they push back due to lack of
testing and existing conventions you decide the proper approach is to
bully them and force the issue with Linus?  I'm used to dealing with
hypocrisy but this is truly something else ...

Adding security_namespace_free() the the disabled BPF LSM hook list
should be a one line change in Linux v7.4 (maybe three if you need a
Kconfig conditional for something) and then a one (maybe three) line
change in Linux v7.5 to allow it again.  Two patches, each at most
three lines, all contained within the BPF subsystem.

If you look at that thread, you'll notice I ended my last mail with a
"Are we all okay with that for this patch?" because I wanted to make
sure everyone was okay with the patch, and the process before merging
it.  Stephen answered that he was okay with the approach and you never
responded; I held the patch back exactly because you never explicitly
okay'd the approach.  I suspect one could make a lot of interesting
observations both about how that patch was handled, and how that
handling is now viewed from different perspectives.

... and when it suits you, or the BPF developers, you override or
otherwise steal ownership from the LSM space.  We obviously see things
different here, but if you're trying to convince me that you are doing
the Right Thing by inserting yourself into some of these discussions,
e.g. the recent LSM kfunc discussion, you are wasting your time.  To
borrow a phrase from Alexei's last email on that subject, "I don't
feel we will converge here".

Please CC the LSM list and me.  I would also encourage you to disclose
the lack of testing you have done prior to the merge window as well as
your insistence that the LSM hooks become a stable API; if Linus is
going to change any of these policies it would be good to know.
