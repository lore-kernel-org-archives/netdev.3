net/rds: unlink transport nodes before a possibly deferred connection free

This patch changes the RDS TCP, loopback and IB teardown helpers so they
unlink each transport node from the on-stack gather list before calling
rds_conn_destroy(). A deferred conn_free() then cannot write into a dead
stack frame. For IB it adds an i_ib_node_detached claim flag and gathers
the nodev list entry by entry under ib_nodev_conns_lock, instead of
splicing it, and it pins each gathered connection with a reference.

> The node is unlinked much later, by the transport's conn_free():
> rds_tcp_conn_free() and rds_loop_conn_free() list_del() it, and
> rds_ib_conn_free() does so unconditionally.

[Severity: Low]
Is this accurate for rds_loop_conn_free()? Before this patch it also
called list_del() unconditionally:

net/rds/loop.c:rds_loop_conn_free() {
	...
	spin_lock_irqsave(&loop_conns_lock, flags);
	list_del(&lc->loop_node);
	...
}

Only rds_tcp_conn_free() checked t_tcp_node_detached first.

> So the gather takes a reference on each connection it moves

The paragraph above this one describes the IB list fix ("For IB this also
closes a race that exists today..."). Should "below" be "above"?

This sentence also falls between "that part is preparation for those
patches" and the sentence that continues it, "So the gather takes a
reference...". It looks like it was left over from an edit.

[Severity: Medium]
This is a pre-existing issue, not one introduced by this patch. Can a late
shutdown leave a connection on ib_nodev_conns that is never destroyed?

At this commit rds_ib_exit() still sweeps the nodev list only once:

net/rds/ib.c:rds_ib_exit() {
	...
	rds_ib_unregister_client();
	rds_ib_destroy_nodev_conns();
	rds_ib_sysctl_exit();
	rds_ib_recv_exit();
	...
}

rds_ib_unregister_client() only waits on rds_wq:

	ib_unregister_client(&rds_ib_client);
	/* wait for rds_ib_dev_free() to complete */
	flush_workqueue(rds_wq);

rds_ib_dev_shutdown() queues the shutdowns on the per-path cp_wq and does
not wait for them:

	list_for_each_entry(ic, &rds_ibdev->conn_list, ib_node)
		rds_conn_path_drop(&ic->conn->c_path[0], true);

A connection whose shutdown has not yet reached rds_ib_remove_conn() is
still on rds_ibdev->conn_list, so rds_ib_destroy_nodev_conns() never
claims it. When that shutdown finishes, i_ib_node_detached is false. The
node is added to ib_nodev_conns here after the only sweep has already run,
and rds_conn_destroy() is never called for it.

The rds_ib_dev_put() that follows can also queue rds_ib_dev_free() on
rds_wq after the flush has returned. Both paths can end up running module
text after rds_rdma is unloaded.

This commit does not claim to fix this; its "closes both" refers to the
stale head corruption and to a connect unlinking a node under the walk.
The next patch in the series, "net/rds: wait for connections to be freed
on transport unload", fixes it. There, rds_ib_exit() follows the sweep
with rds_conn_wait_conns_freed(&rds_ib_transport,
rds_ib_destroy_nodev_conns), which sweeps again on every poll until
t_conn_count reaches zero, and then runs a second flush_workqueue(rds_wq).

[Severity: Low]
Because of the "Fixes: 4716af3897e9" tag, this commit will be a stable
candidate. However, rds_conn_get_unless_zero() and rds_conn_put() don't
exist at the series baseline. They come from the previous patch, "net/rds:
split connection destroy into quiesce and kref-governed free", which has
no Fixes: tag.

Would a backport to a tree that has 4716af3897e9 but not the kref rework
fail to build?

The commit message calls the per-entry references "preparation" and says
"The IB list handling is a fix in its own right". It does not name the
prerequisite, for example with a stable dependency note. Later in the
series, "net/rds: hold a connection reference from struct rds_incoming"
leaves out a Fixes: tag for this same reason.

The IB list fix (the entry-by-entry gather under ib_nodev_conns_lock plus
the i_ib_node_detached claim) does not need the references while frees
are still synchronous. Could it be split out as a standalone patch that
goes ahead of the kref rework?
