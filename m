net: stmmac: drop split frames on AF_XDP zero-copy RX

This patch changes stmmac_rx_zc() so that, in AF_XDP zero-copy mode, a
frame spanning more than one RX descriptor sets error on its first
descriptor. The remaining descriptors, including the last one, are then
freed instead of being processed as a new frame. It also moves the buffer
free into the common error block and adjusts the rx_dropped and count
accounting.

[Severity: Low]
Is this snippet the post-patch version rather than the existing code? It
contains rx_dropped++ and error = 1 and has no count++. Those are the
exact lines this patch adds and removes. The pre-patch branch was:

        if (likely(status & rx_not_ls)) {
                xsk_buff_free(buf->xdp);
                buf->xdp = NULL;
                dirty++;
                count++;
                goto read_again;
        }

The next sentence says the frame is not marked as errored. That
contradicts the error = 1 in the quoted snippet.

Could the snippet be replaced with the original code?

[Severity: Low]
On GMAC4/XGMAC, does this change how split frames with a hardware error
are counted?

The first descriptor of a multi-descriptor frame returns rx_not_ls from
dwmac4_wrback_get_rx_status(). It takes the 1:1 path further down, which
now does rx_dropped++ and error = 1.

The last descriptor may then return discard_frame because ES is set (CRC,
overflow, watchdog, giant). In that case the && !error guard here is
false, so rx_errors++ is skipped.

Before the patch, the 1:1 path did not set error. The last descriptor's
discard_frame incremented rx_errors, and rx_dropped was not touched.

The per-cause xstats counters are still incremented. However, ip -s link
now reports the frame as dropped rather than errored. Is that intended?
The commit message only says the frame is counted once in rx_dropped.

[Severity: High]
Does this fix also cover cores that use normal or enhanced RX descriptors
(dwmac100 and dwmac1000)? The continuation logic here relies on non-last
descriptors reporting rx_not_ls. Only dwmac4_wrback_get_rx_status() and
the dwxgmac2 callback do that.

enh_desc_get_rx_status() and ndesc_get_rx_status() report a non-last
descriptor like this:

drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/enh_desc.c:enh_desc_get_rx_status() {
    ...
	if (unlikely(!(rdes0 & RDES0_LAST_DESCRIPTOR))) {
		x->rx_length++;
		return discard_frame;
	}
    ...
}

With that encoding, a frame split across two descriptors goes through
stmmac_rx_zc() like this:

first descriptor:
    in_progress = status & rx_not_ls;          /* 0 */
    status == discard_frame && !error  ->  error = 1
    error block frees buf->xdp, dirty++
    (status & rx_not_ls) is 0  ->  count++; continue;

next loop iteration:
    if (!in_progress) { error = 0; len = 0; }

last descriptor:
    good status, so it skips the error block and the 1:1 rx_not_ls check

The tail is then processed as a complete new frame. With len == 0,
stmmac_rx_buf1_len() returns:

	return min_t(unsigned int, priv->dma_conf.dma_buf_sz, plen - len);

That value is dma_buf_sz, but the DMA only wrote the tail remainder into
that XSK buffer. The tail starts mid-payload and goes to the XDP program,
to XDP_TX, or to stmmac_dispatch_skb_zc() on XDP_PASS.

Isn't that the same symptom the commit message says this patch removes?

This path looks reachable:

- __stmmac_dvr_probe() advertises NETDEV_XDP_ACT_XSK_ZEROCOPY for every
  core.
- stmmac_xdp_enable_pool() only checks the queue indices and the frame
  size. It does not check the core or the descriptor format.
- dwmac1000 and dwmac100 have no .set_bfsize op. The buffer size
  programmed by stmmac_clear_rx_descriptors() is therefore dma_buf_sz,
  which is 1536 at MTU 1500.

dwmac1000_core_init() only enables the larger frame modes above
MTU 1500:

	if (mtu > 1500)
		value |= GMAC_CONTROL_2K;
	if (mtu > 2000)
		value |= GMAC_CONTROL_JE;

XDP limits the MTU to 1500, so neither bit is set. It appears an on-link
peer could still send a frame between 1536 bytes and the 2048-byte
watchdog limit, and the hardware would split it across two descriptors.

Would it work better to track continuation from the hardware LD/FD bits?
Other options are to have the enh/norm callbacks report rx_not_ls for
non-last descriptors, or to refuse XSK zero-copy on these descriptor
formats.

[Severity: Low]
This is a pre-existing issue and was not introduced by this patch. The
new rx_dropped++ feeds into this accumulator at the end of
stmmac_rx_zc():

	priv->xstats.rx_dropped += rx_dropped;
	priv->xstats.rx_errors += rx_errors;

stmmac_rx() does the same thing. Each channel has its own NAPI instance.
RX queues polling on different CPUs can therefore do these non-atomic
read-modify-writes on the device-wide unsigned long fields at the same
time. stmmac_get_stats64() also reads them without any synchronization.

Can increments to rx_dropped and rx_errors be lost when two queues finish
their polls at the same time?
