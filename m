net: rds: fix uninitialized trans dereference in CM event handler

This commit initializes trans to &rds_ib_transport in
rds_rdma_cm_event_handler_cmn() and drops the conditional assignment on
the node type. It also rejects RDMA_CM_EVENT_CONNECT_REQUEST when the
request arrives on a non-IB device, so an RDS listener no longer crashes
when an iWARP device gets a connect request.

[Severity: High]
This check only covers the passive side, and only for
RDMA_CM_EVENT_CONNECT_REQUEST. Can an outgoing RDS/IB connection still
end up on an iWARP RNIC? If so, would it oops in the
RDMA_CM_EVENT_ROUTE_RESOLVED case of this same handler?

rds_ib_conn_path_connect() creates the id without restricting its node
type:

net/rds/ib_cm.c:rds_ib_conn_path_connect() {
    ...
	ic->i_cm_id = rdma_create_id(&init_net, handler, conn,
				     RDMA_PS_TCP, IB_QPT_RC);
    ...
	ret = rdma_resolve_addr(ic->i_cm_id, (struct sockaddr *)&src,
				(struct sockaddr *)&dest,
				RDS_RDMA_RESOLVE_TIMEOUT_MS);
    ...
}

restricted_node_type stays RDMA_NODE_UNSPECIFIED. That means
cma_acquire_dev_by_src_ip() can pick any device that matches
conn->c_laddr, including an RNIC:

drivers/infiniband/core/cma.c:cma_acquire_dev_by_src_ip() {
    ...
		if (id_priv->restricted_node_type != RDMA_NODE_UNSPECIFIED &&
		    id_priv->restricted_node_type != cma_dev->device->node_type)
			continue;
    ...
}

After ADDR_RESOLVED, rdma_resolve_route() on an iWARP port goes to
cma_resolve_iw_route(). That function queues ROUTE_RESOLVED but never
allocates cm_id->route.path_rec. The handler then runs:

	case RDMA_CM_EVENT_ROUTE_RESOLVED:
		...
			if (ibic && ibic->i_cm_id == cm_id) {
				cm_id->route.path_rec[0].sl =
					TOS_TO_SL(conn->c_tos);
				ret = trans->cm_initiate_connect(cm_id, isv6);

Isn't that a write through a NULL path_rec in the cma_wq worker? It
would happen with id_priv->handler_mutex and conn->c_cm_lock held. The
write comes before trans is used, so initializing trans doesn't prevent
it.

There seem to be two ways to reach this.

The first is remote. On a host with both an IB_CA device and an iWARP
device, a peer sends an RDS REQ over the IB device, so the new check
passes. In the private data, dp_daddr is the local iWARP interface
address and dp_saddr is a neighbour on that subnet.

rds_ib_cm_handle_connect() hands these addresses to rds_conn_create()
without checking that laddr belongs to the device the request arrived
on. The connection is hashed.

After a disconnect or setup failure, the reconnect then uses the
addresses the peer chose:

rds_conn_shutdown()
  rds_queue_reconnect()
    rds_connect_worker()
      rds_ib_conn_path_connect()

The lowest-address rule in rds_queue_reconnect() only applies to TCP,
so it doesn't stop this.

The second is local. A socket bound to an address on an IB device
passes rds_ib_laddr_check_cm() at bind time. If that address later
moves to an iWARP netdev, rds_sendmsg() reuses rs->rs_transport and
doesn't check the device again.

The same crash was possible before this patch. However, the commit
message lists ROUTE_RESOLVED among the cases that crash on non-IB
devices, and says:

  "IB is the only transport left, so make that explicit"

while only incoming requests are rejected.

Would it work to call rdma_restrict_node_type(id, RDMA_NODE_IB_CA) on
the ids RDS creates, meaning the active id in
rds_ib_conn_path_connect() and the listen ids? smbdirect already uses
this helper. cma_acquire_dev_by_src_ip() and cma_listen_on_dev() both
honour it, and it could replace the per-event check here.

Another option is to check the device type on ADDR_RESOLVED or
ROUTE_RESOLVED, then call rds_conn_drop() and return 0, so RDS keeps
ownership of the id.
