I understand what you meant. Sure, we can generate the initial time in
the tcp_sendmsg_locked() and try to pass it on to each skb in
skb_entail(), which means 1) we need at least two hooks, which brings
obvious overhead, 2) it's still not that easy to use as I expect it to
be super easy to use/write/deploy, 3) I try to decouple it from BPF
infra or complex use for the convenience. It looks like we now go back
to BPF Timestamping V1.0.

Adding hooks does harm to the performance to those real
latency-sensitive users who were actually yelling at us. There are
some interesting numbers I collected previously (Sorry, I will not be
able to collect more real data because I left that company:( ):
1) The kernel module introduces around 5-15% performance impact in the
real workload. After we removed the hook in tcp_sendmsg_locked, even
though the module didn't have the full function to calculate the
latency, the cost was decreased by ~3-5%.
2) Fentry has ~4% impact on some workloads. It's very similar to what
we use netperf on loopback [1].

The crucial idea behind the feature is that we're trying so hard to
deploy the latency platform 7x24 without any selective sampling. It
now looks like an advanced/21-century tcpdump and it can be
_always-on_. If someone is just looking for one-shot tools, of course
there are a few alternatives that are not good enough though.
