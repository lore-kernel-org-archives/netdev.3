Thanks for the review, Simon.

All four points are correct. Because the 3rd point removes part of the 
patch,
v2 will be sent as a series.

Yes. For SMC-D and SMC-R with physically contiguous RMBs, nr_pages is 1, so
the transfer is all-or-nothing. I will clarify in the commit message that a
short count only happens on SMC-R with virtually contiguous RMBs (is_vm).

Yes. The "goto out" skips atomic_sub(), so chunk 0 bytes are never
subtracted from bytes_to_rcv. But the pipe reader still updates the cursor,
leaving bytes_to_rcv permanently incorrect.

I will fix this in the series: when chunk 1 fails after chunk 0 was
delivered, set copylen to chunk 0 length and break instead of "goto out".
The memcpy_to_msg() path has the same problem and will be fixed as well.

Yes, it is unreachable. smc_rx_splice() always passes nr_pages >= 1, so
splice_to_pipe() returns -EAGAIN instead of 0.

The zero case arrives as -EAGAIN, which the existing code turns into
-EFAULT. In v2, I will drop the dead arm and return rc directly instead
of -EFAULT (which also fixes -ENOMEM reporting). I will also reword the
comment.

Yes. I will move the subtraction inside lock_sock() and keep the wake-up
outside. I will send this in a separate patch.

v2 will follow as a series
