net/iucv: serialize HiperSockets receive with the socket lock

This patch makes afiucv_hs_rcv() take bh_lock_sock() once. While a task
owns the socket, frames are deferred to the socket backlog, which is
bounded by frame count and drained by a per-socket sk_backlog_rcv. It also
runs recvmsg() under lock_sock(), lets sendmsg() wait for send memory
without the lock, and sends the FIN and first SHT past sk_sndbuf.

[Severity: Low]
The only trailers are Suggested-by, Link and Signed-off-by. There is no
Fixes: tag.

The changelog describes bugs users can see that go back to 3881ac441f64
("af_iucv: add HiperSockets transport"):

- a SHT or FIN lost to a full send buffer
- a window update that fails and keeps its credit, so recvmsg() hits
  WARN_ON(1) and returns -EFAULT

The notes below the --- line say this iucv_send_ctrl() change could go to
net on its own with Fixes: 3881ac441f64. They also say the credit drop in
recvmsg() fixes a bug in net today.

If both stay folded into one net-next patch, will stable pick them up?
Could the iucv_send_ctrl() fix, and possibly the credit drop, go to net
as separate patches with Fixes: tags?

[Severity: Low]
This is a pre-existing issue and was not introduced by this patch. A
reader that is asleep here when the peer's FIN arrives gets -ENOTCONN. A
recvmsg() that starts after the FIN returns 0 through the IUCV_DISCONN
shortcut at the top of iucv_sock_recvmsg().

The old path, skb_recv_datagram()->__skb_wait_for_more_packets(), also
returned -ENOTCONN in this case, because IUCV_CONNECTED equals
TCP_ESTABLISHED. So this keeps the existing behaviour.

Should a blocked reader also see EOF here, like a reader that arrives
after the FIN?

[Severity: Medium]
Can repeated SHT frames still drive recvmsg() into the WARN_ON(1) and
-EFAULT above?

On the peer, every shutdown(SHUT_WR) while connected sends another SHT:

iucv_sock_shutdown()
    ...
    } else
        iucv_send_ctrl(sk, AF_IUCV_FLAG_SHT);

These SHTs don't use any window, since only sendmsg() increments
msg_sent. Here, each one becomes a zero-length skb, and consuming it does
atomic_inc(&iucv->msg_recv).

msg_recv is only reset through send_win. send_win is only set when
backlog_skb_q is empty after the requeue loop, and the new credit drop
depends on send_win too.

Suppose the peer sends a full window of data, then enough repeated SHTs
that the receive queue spills into backlog_skb_q. backlog_skb_q may then
stay non-empty while msg_recv keeps climbing.

Would the first SHT read then push msg_recv past iucv->msglimit? That
would make recvmsg() call __iucv_sock_close() and return -EFAULT instead
of EOF. The comment in afiucv_hs_backlog_add() says "a repeated one
carries nothing", but such an SHT still seems to count here.

[Severity: High]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but does this refusal path
leak nsk?

iucv_sock_kill() does nothing unless SOCK_ZAPPED is set:

static void iucv_sock_kill(struct sock *sk)
{
	if (!sock_flag(sk, SOCK_ZAPPED) || sk->sk_socket)
		return;
	...
}

iucv_sock_alloc() clears SOCK_ZAPPED, and only __iucv_sock_close() sets
it. None of these paths call __iucv_sock_close(). So each SYN refused
here seems to leave a whole iucv_sock linked on iucv_sk_list, still
holding its sk_alloc() reference. That covers a listener not in
IUCV_LISTEN and a full accept queue.

The same applies to the iucv_sock_kill(nsk) after a failed
dev_queue_xmit() of the SYN|ACK further down. There, the
dev_hold(niucv->hs_dev) reference would leak too, and
unregister_netdev() of that device could wait forever.

A peer on the HiperSockets LAN can repeat connect() against a listener
with a full accept queue, so this can grow without bound. The leaked
sockets also lengthen the iucv_sk_list walk in afiucv_hs_rcv() for every
frame.

With this patch, deferred SYNs reach the same path through
afiucv_hs_backlog_rcv()->afiucv_hs_dispatch()->afiucv_hs_callback_syn().
The changelog also names the full-accept-queue refusal as the model for
the new refusal past the budget.

[Severity: Medium]
Does this classification hold up for frames the dispatcher doesn't act
on?

While the socket is owned, every flags value outside {0, SHT, WIN} is
deferred and charged to sk_backlog_ctrl. That includes values that
afiucv_hs_dispatch() only frees in its default case. It also includes a
SYN|ACK or SYN|FIN for a socket that isn't IUCV_BOUND, which the
callbacks just drop.

On a socket that isn't listening, the control limit is
sk_max_ack_backlog + 2, which is 2. Two such frames in one ownership
period would leave no room for a real FIN. The FIN would then go to
kfree_skb_reason(skb, SKB_DROP_REASON_SOCKET_BACKLOG) and never be
resent.

Each deferred stray frame also makes sk_backlog.len non-zero. Later data
and pure WIN frames are then deferred too and charged to the
msglimit + 1 data budget.

With traffic in both directions, msglimit data frames plus two or more
pure WINs, could data frames be dropped as well? Before this patch these
stray frames were freed right away.

Would it make sense to drop unknown flags in afiucv_hs_rcv() before
deciding whether to defer?

[Severity: Medium]
Can this budget end up smaller than the window the peer was granted?

The SYN advertises the msglimit that is current at connect() time:

afiucv_hs_send()
	if (flags == AF_IUCV_FLAG_SYN)
		phs_hdr->window = iucv->msglimit;

However, iucv_sock_setsockopt(SO_MSGLIMIT) still accepts the option in
IUCV_BOUND. A HiperSockets socket stays in IUCV_BOUND from the moment
iucv_sock_connect() sends its SYN until the SYN|ACK arrives. That window
is open after:

- a non-blocking, timed-out or interrupted connect()
- another thread calls setsockopt() while a blocking connect() sleeps in
  iucv_sock_wait() with the lock released

If msglimit is lowered in that window, the peer can still send a full
window of the old size. Those frames wait behind the deferred SYN|ACK.
Every frame past the new msglimit + 1 is dropped here with
SKB_DROP_REASON_SOCKET_BACKLOG and never resent, so stream data is lost
without any error. The msg_recv > iucv->msglimit check in
iucv_sock_recvmsg() would also use the lowered value.

The notes below the --- line call this the one remaining gap, but the
code still allows it. Could SO_MSGLIMIT be rejected once a HiperSockets
SYN has gone out? Alternatively, could the advertised window be saved and
used for this budget?
