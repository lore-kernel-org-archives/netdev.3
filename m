Yes, the wildcard traded one misdelivery for another.  I've send a v3
that gives the connected peer its own scope field as suggested.  That shoul=
d
also take care of the global-destination case in the second point as well.

Yes, but that is baseline, and I have a fix for that in the connection-life=
time
series ("net/rds: hold connection references in lookup, sockets and c_passi=
ve")
targeted to net-next.  A snapshot here would still leave the pointer
unreferenced across the test, so I'd rather not grow a net fix into a
partial copy of that.

Thanks!
