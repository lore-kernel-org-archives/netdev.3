The HiperSockets receive callbacks change sk_state under bh_lock_sock()
without testing sock_owned_by_user(). A SYN|ACK, SYN|FIN or FIN that
arrives during a system call on the socket is applied under the task
that holds lock_sock(), which goes on with the state it read. A SYN is
answered for a listener that close() is emptying: the child is left on
the accept queue of a socket that is then freed, and nothing can close
it. It keeps the listener's name, so bind() to that name fails with
-EADDRINUSE from then on, and it keeps its reference on the net device.

Either needs only a frame from the peer at the wrong moment. No
memory-safety report is known.

Take bh_lock_sock() once in afiucv_hs_rcv(), for every frame that finds
a socket. While a task owns it:

- A SYN|ACK, SYN|FIN or FIN is recorded in the socket and applied by
  the owner from proto->release_cb. It is not queued: nothing resends a
  control frame, and the socket backlog can refuse one under memory
  pressure, since it does not take a pfmemalloc skb.
  connect() applies a recorded reply before it tests the state, so a
  non-blocking connect() still sees a reply that is already in.
- Data, SHT and WIN frames do not change sk_state and are handled on
  arrival, as before. They wait in the socket backlog only while the
  reply to our SYN is recorded and not applied yet, and behind frames
  that wait already, up to the window given to the peer plus one.
- A SYN for a listener waits in the backlog, cut to its header, up to
  the accept queue plus one. Past that, or if the listener closed or
  its queue filled meanwhile, it is refused without a child.

A frame that no state of the socket can use is freed in afiucv_hs_rcv()
and such a SYN refused there: a SYN|ACK or SYN|FIN outside IUCV_BOUND,
a FIN for a socket neither connected nor about to be, and data, SHT and
WIN frames behind a recorded FIN. A SYN for a socket that does not
listen was refused only after a child had been allocated for it, and
that child was never freed; it is now refused without one. A listener
whose accept queue is full still leaks the child when no task owns it,
as before.

v3:
- only the softirq side of the lock is left here; 1/7 to 4/7, 6/7 and
  7/7 took the rest, and the cover letter lists what was dropped. Up to
  this patch the parked reader still gets -ENOTCONN at the peer's FIN,
  as on net; 7/7 changes that
- afiucv_hs_stray() calls a FIN a stray unless the socket is
  IUCV_CONNECTED or a recorded SYN|ACK is about to connect it. v2
  recorded a FIN that reached a socket in IUCV_BOUND and applied it
  after the SYN|ACK (AI review of v2, first item)
- data, SHT and WIN frames behind a recorded FIN are strays too, as
  afiucv_hs_callback_rx() frees them once the FIN is applied. v2 handled
  them as connected (second item)
- connect() applies a recorded reply to its SYN before it tests the
  state. v1 and v2 left the reply for release_sock(): a non-blocking
  connect() returned -EAGAIN with the SYN|ACK, or the SYN|FIN, already
  in, where net returns 0 or -ECONNREFUSED
- kernel-doc on every function added, with its context; the comment on
  afiucv_hs_defer() is rewritten (the reason v2 gave there was stale),
  the one on afiucv_hs_backlog_add() says why frames are counted
- on net, with nothing under it
v2: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20261022-b4-disp-1d26b87a-v2-1-7ee1264d812a@proton.me/
v1: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20261011-b4-disp-410518f4-v1-1-753bf3258292@proton.me/

Repro of the listener in the message's first paragraph. The window is a
few instructions wide, between the last child taken off the accept
queue and the listener's IUCV_CLOSED, so the test kernels have an
mdelay(400) there and a SYN is sent 100 ms into the close(). net with
the delay: connect() returns 0, nothing ever accepts or closes the
child, one socket stays in use after both ends are closed, and a new
bind() to the listener's name fails with -EADDRINUSE. The series with
the same delay: the SYN waits in the listener's backlog, is refused
when the close is done, and connect() returns -ECONNREFUSED; nothing is
left and the name binds again. With the SYN sent before the close()
both kernels free the child. Not seen without the delay, and no KASAN
splat with it.

Strays are freed in afiucv_hs_rcv(): a FIN with consume_skb(), as
afiucv_hs_callback_fin() frees it on net, the rest as NO_SOCKET drops.
With the drop trace on, a second FIN for a socket the first one
disconnected leaves no kfree_skb event, on net and here; the series
with that FIN dropped like the other strays leaves one NO_SOCKET drop.
A data byte sent the same way is a drop on every kernel.

The SYN for a socket that does not listen, measured: 16 connect() calls
to a socket that is bound and does not listen, each refused. On net and
up to 4/7 they leave 16 sockets in use after everything is closed, from
this patch on none. The full accept queue is not fixed: 1056 SYNs
refused by a listener whose queue is full leave 1056 sockets in use, on
net and with the series.

The backlog's budget is the window of 1/7 plus one, so a socket
connected by a SYN|ACK without a SYN of its own counts against msglimit
there too. With the socket held, three one-byte messages behind such a
SYN|ACK are all read after the release. With the budget read from
msglimit_adv alone, one is read and two are SOCKET_BACKLOG drops.

The first two items of the AI review repro on v2 as sent and are gone
here. Both hold the socket with a task parked in setsockopt(), its
filter a userfaultfd page, and send it one forged frame over the
emulated adapter. First: the socket's SYN is held
back, so it is IUCV_BOUND and no SYN|ACK exists; a FIN arrives, then the
SYN is released and the SYN|ACK comes in. v2 connects and disconnects
at the release; v3 frees the FIN as it arrives and a byte goes each way
afterwards. With the FIN sent after the SYN|ACK instead, both apply it.
Second: the peer sends one byte and closes, then a forged data frame
arrives behind its FIN. v2 delivers the forged byte after the real one;
v3 frees it and the reader gets EOF. net and v1 behave as v3 in both.
v1 queued control frames and ran them in order, so both came in when v2
began to record them instead. With any FIN recorded again the first
test fails; with frames let through behind a recorded FIN, the second.

With any one of these pieces taken out, at least one test fails: the
release callback that applies what was recorded, the wait for the
owner, the reply to our SYN applied before the backlog runs, connect()
applying that reply, either half of afiucv_hs_stray()'s rule for a FIN,
its rule for frames behind one, the whole of afiucv_hs_stray(), the
budget read through the window helper, and the stray FIN consumed. Of
the 53 default tests the kernel with 1/7 to 5/7 fails six: the five in
the cover letter and the parked reader's -ENOTCONN, which 7/7 changes.

By inspection only, no repro: a pfmemalloc skb refused by the backlog,
the device reference a waiting SYN holds, and the SOCK_ZAPPED test in
afiucv_hs_apply().
