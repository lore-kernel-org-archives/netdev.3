net: enetc: Add pseudo-MAC support for ENETCv4 Ports via a fixed-link node

This commit lets ENETCv4 pseudo-MAC ports probe when they have no static
DT description. At probe time it uses an of_changeset to add a
fixed-link child node to the port's OF node, with the speed taken from
PCR[PSPEED], so that phylink can pick it up. The changeset is reverted
and destroyed on teardown and on the probe error path.

[Severity: Medium]
Does this rounding end up overwriting the boot-time PCR[PSPEED] value?

enetc4_get_pcr_speed() decodes PSPEED as (pspeed + 1) * 10, so the
result can be any multiple of 10 Mbps. enetc_phylink_match_pseudo_mac_speed()
then rounds down to the first table entry that is <= that value, with no
warning. For example, 4000 becomes 2500 and 40000 becomes 25000.

The rounded value goes into the fixed-link "speed" property. On link-up,
phylink passes it to enetc4_pl_mac_link_up(), which has no pseudo-MAC
check:

enetc4_pl_mac_link_up()
    enetc4_set_port_speed(priv, speed);

priv->speed starts at 0, so the first call always does a read-modify-write
of ENETC4_PCR with PCR_PSPEED_VAL(rounded speed).

Suppose the switch owner programmed a PSPEED that is not in the table.
Wouldn't the driver replace it with a lower rate? priv->speed is used by
enetc_qos.c for the CBS port_transmit_rate. Wouldn't it also stop
matching the real internal link?

This seems to conflict with the commit message statement that "the fixed
link reflects the actual boot-time configuration". I could not confirm
whether firmware actually programs rates outside the table.

[Severity: Medium]
Will this build when CONFIG_OF_DYNAMIC is not set?

This function calls of_changeset_init(), of_changeset_create_node(),
of_changeset_add_prop_u32(), of_changeset_add_prop_bool() and
of_changeset_apply(). enetc4_put_ppm_fixed_link() also calls
of_changeset_revert() and of_changeset_destroy(). All of these are
declared in include/linux/of.h only under #ifdef CONFIG_OF_DYNAMIC.

The #else branch only has stubs for the of_reconfig_* helpers.
drivers/of/dynamic.c is also only built with OF_DYNAMIC=y.

config NXP_ENETC4 only depends on PTP_1588_CLOCK_OPTIONAL and PCI_MSI.
OF_DYNAMIC is a hidden symbol that is only enabled when something
selects it (OF_OVERLAY, PCI_DYNAMIC_OF_NODES, ...).

With NXP_ENETC4=y/m and OF_DYNAMIC=n, wouldn't the build fail? I'd
expect implicit declaration errors first, then undefined symbols at
modpost or link time. That includes CONFIG_OF=n builds through
COMPILE_TEST.

The commit message says:

  This is intentionally not a hard Kconfig dependency, since the ENETC4
  driver also serves regular ports described by static DT; when
  PCI_DYNAMIC_OF_NODES is absent the PCI function has no of_node and the
  pseudo-MAC probe path fails gracefully with a clear -ENODEV error.

If nothing selects OF_DYNAMIC, the driver would not build at all, so it
never gets to the -ENODEV path. Should NXP_ENETC4 select or depend on
OF_DYNAMIC, or should these calls be guarded?

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a functional bug, but can this write a speed that the
fixed-link binding doesn't allow?

enetc_phylink_pseudo_mac_caps[] includes SPEED_25000 and SPEED_20000. For
PSPEED >= 20 Gbps, enetc_phylink_match_pseudo_mac_speed() returns 20000
or 25000.

For the object form of fixed-link, the "speed" property in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/ethernet-controller.yaml only
allows:

  enum: [10, 100, 1000, 2500, 5000, 10000]

The commit message says the node is added "exactly as if it had come
from static DT". A static DT describing this port the same way would
fail dtschema validation. phylink_parse_fixedlink() accepts these speeds
at runtime, so nothing breaks.

Should the binding be extended to 20000 and 25000, or should the driver
avoid emitting them?

[Severity: Medium]
Can OF_DYNAMIC be relied on to mean the node has no link description?

OF_DYNAMIC only records that a node was allocated at runtime.
__of_node_dup() sets it on every runtime-created node. That includes
nodes created by the overlay engine (add_changeset_node()->__of_node_dup())
and PCI-synthesized nodes that a later overlay fills in. The
PCI-synthesized node is not empty either, since it has compatible and
reg.

Take an OF_DYNAMIC pseudo-MAC node that already has phy-mode and a
fixed-link child. This path skips of_get_phy_mode() and forces
PHY_INTERFACE_MODE_INTERNAL. enetc4_add_ppm_fixed_link() then adds a
second child named "fixed-link" without checking for an existing one.

__of_attach_node() inserts the new node at the head of the parent's
child list:

	np->sibling = np->parent->child;
	np->parent->child = np;

So phylink_parse_fixedlink()->fwnode_get_named_child_node(fwnode,
"fixed-link") would find the synthesized node first. Wouldn't the
overlay's speed, pause, asym-pause and link-gpios be silently ignored?
The tree would also end up with two sibling nodes of the same name.

Before this patch, such a node went through of_get_phy_mode() and its
own fixed-link was used. Would a check based on the node's contents (no
phy-mode, no phy-handle, and !of_phy_is_fixed_link()) match the intent
in the comment better than the flag?

I couldn't find in-tree code that applies such an overlay to an ENETC
node today, so this may be theoretical for now.
