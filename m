s390/ctcm: Fix use-after-free in channel_remove()

In channel_remove(), this patch replaces fsm_deltimer() with
timer_shutdown_sync() for ch->timer and ch->sweep_timer. It also moves
the MPC tasklet_kill() calls and kfree(ch->discontact_th) so they run
after the timers are shut down and before kfree_fsm(ch->fsm).

[Severity: High]
Do these waits run too late to protect the state that the channel
callbacks use?

The only teardown caller of channel_remove() is ctcm_shutdown_device(),
and it calls it after the net_device and its private state are gone:

drivers/s390/net/ctcm_main.c:ctcm_shutdown_device() {
    ...
	if (dev) {
		unregister_netdev(dev);
		ctcm_free_netdevice(dev);
	}
    ...
	ccw_device_set_offline(cgdev->cdev[1]);
	ccw_device_set_offline(cgdev->cdev[0]);
	channel_remove(priv->channel[CTCM_READ]);
	channel_remove(priv->channel[CTCM_WRITE]);
    ...
}

ctcm_free_netdevice() does kfree_fsm(grp->fsm), kfree(grp),
priv->mpcg = NULL, kfree_fsm(priv->fsm) and priv->fsm = NULL. Under MODULE
it also calls free_netdev(dev). The ccw_device_set_offline() calls in
between can sleep, so a channel timer or tasklet can fire in that window.

The channel callbacks reach this state through ch->netdev->ml_priv:

  ctcm_chx_txretry() (ch->timer):
	fsm_event(priv->fsm, DEV_EVENT_TXDOWN, dev);

  ctcmpc_chx_send_sweep() (sweep_timer):
	if (grp->in_sweep == 0)

  ctcmpc_bh() (ch_tasklet):
	while ((fsm_getstate(grp->fsm) != MPCG_STATE_FLOWC) &&

  ctcm_ccw_check_rc()->ctcm_chx_iofatal():
	fsm_event(priv->fsm, ...);

The circular chain in the commit message also goes through priv->fsm or
priv->mpcg. For example, mpc_action_go_inop() does this before it reaches
tasklet_hi_schedule():

	grp =  priv->mpcg;
	grp->flow_off_called = 0;

At channel_remove() time priv->fsm and priv->mpcg are already freed or
NULL. Wouldn't that chain crash before it can re-arm anything?

If so, timer_shutdown_sync() only waits for a callback that is already
dereferencing freed or NULL memory. tasklet_kill() also lets a queued
ch_tasklet run against the freed grp.

channel_free() moves ch->fsm to CTC_STATE_IDLE, which has no handlers,
so most late ch->fsm events do nothing. But that state change takes no
lock. ctcm_irq_handler() runs FSM actions under the ccwdev lock, and for
MPC ctcm_close() does nothing:

	if (!IS_MPC(priv))
		fsm_event(priv->fsm, DEV_EVENT_STOP, dev);

As a result the MPC channels are not halted. An action that races
channel_free() could leave the channel FSM in TXIDLE or TX with timers
armed.

ctcmpc_bh() never checks the ch->fsm state, and ctc_mpc_flow_control()
can schedule it at any time.

The ctcm_new_device() out_dev path uses the same order, but its channels
were never started there.

Could both channels' timers and tasklets be stopped, and the subchannels
taken offline, before ctcm_free_netdevice() and kfree_fsm(priv->fsm) run?
That would mean moving the quiescing out of channel_remove() instead of
reordering it inside channel_remove().

[Severity: High]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but the other fsm_timers in
this driver seem to follow the same pattern: cancel without a sync, then
free.

priv->restart_timer is bound to priv->fsm by fsm_settimer() in
ctcm_init_netdevice(). grp->timer is bound to grp->fsm by fsm_settimer()
in ctcmpc_init_mpc_group(). Neither timer is ever cancelled with a sync
call. The only cancellations are fsm_deltimer(), which is timer_delete().

mpc_action_go_inop() always re-arms the restart timer:

	fsm_deltimer(&priv->restart_timer);
	fsm_addtimer(&priv->restart_timer, 500, DEV_EVENT_RESTART, dev);

dev_action_restart() re-arms it for 1s in the MPC case. So during MPC
group recovery the restart timer is usually pending.

For MPC, ctcm_close() does nothing. So ctcm_shutdown_device() then calls
ctcm_free_netdevice(), which frees grp->fsm, grp (which contains
grp->timer) and priv->fsm while these timers may be pending or running.
After that, ctcm_remove_device() does kfree(priv), and priv contains
restart_timer.

When one of these timers expires, fsm_expire_timer() calls
fsm_event(this->fi, ...) on a freed fsm_instance. That reads the freed
state and jumpmatrix, and calls a function pointer taken from freed
memory. A timer still pending inside freed grp or priv memory can also
corrupt the timer wheel.

There is a similar ordering problem in ctcm_free_netdevice():

	if (grp->fsm)
		kfree_fsm(grp->fsm);
	dev_kfree_skb(grp->xid_skb);
	dev_kfree_skb(grp->rcvd_xid_skb);
	tasklet_kill(&grp->mpc_tasklet2);
	kfree(grp);

Can a pending mpc_tasklet2 run here after its FSM has been freed?

Should priv->restart_timer and grp->timer also get timer_shutdown_sync()
before priv->fsm and grp are freed? And should mpc_tasklet2 be killed
before kfree_fsm(grp->fsm)?
