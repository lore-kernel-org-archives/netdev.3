sctp: carry peer capabilities across an INIT collision

sctp_assoc_update() folds a temporary association into an existing one when
an INIT collision is resolved, and today it only copies asoc->c, peer.rwnd,
peer.sack_needed, peer.auth_capable and peer.i.  This patch extends the copy
block with prsctp_capable, ecn_capable, asconf_capable, reconf_capable,
intl_capable, ipv4_address and ipv6_address so the surviving association
reflects what the peer advertised in the colliding INIT.

A few questions about the state that is derived from those bits but is not
refreshed by the merge.

[Severity: High]

Turning these two bits on lets the surviving association accept inbound
ASCONF and RE-CONFIG, but the receive-side sequence counters those features
compare against are still the survivor's own.

Both are derived from the peer's Initial TSN in sctp_process_init(), which in
a collision runs on the temporary association only:

net/sctp/sm_make_chunk.c:sctp_process_init() {
	...
	asoc->strreset_inseq = asoc->peer.i.initial_tsn;
	...
	asoc->peer.addip_serial = asoc->peer.i.initial_tsn - 1;
}

sctp_assoc_update() copies asoc->peer.i but leaves peer.addip_serial and
strreset_inseq untouched, so a COOKIE_WAIT survivor keeps zero for both.

Can the peer's ASCONF then never be processed?  sctp_sf_do_asconf() now
clears the capability gate and reaches:

net/sctp/sm_statefuns.c:sctp_sf_do_asconf() {
	...
	if (serial == asoc->peer.addip_serial + 1) {
	...
	} else if (serial < asoc->peer.addip_serial + 1) {
	...
	} else {
		/* discarded */
	}
}

With the peer's serial equal to its Initial TSN and peer.addip_serial at 0,
neither arm matches and the chunk lands in the final else, so no ASCONF-ACK
is sent.  Does the peer then retransmit until its T4 limit and give up on
ASCONF entirely?

The RE-CONFIG side has the same shape.  sctp_process_strreset_outreq(), and
equally the inreq/tsnreq/addstrm_out/addstrm_in handlers, validate against
the stale strreset_inseq:

net/sctp/stream.c:sctp_process_strreset_outreq() {
	...
	if (TSN_lt(asoc->strreset_inseq, request_seq) ||
	    TSN_lt(request_seq, asoc->strreset_inseq - 2)) {
		result = SCTP_STRRESET_ERR_BAD_SEQNO;
		goto err;
	}
}

The testing notes describe ASCONF and RE-CONFIG appearing on the wire, which
exercises the outbound counters (addip_serial and strreset_outseq, both set
locally from asoc->c.initial_tsn).  Was the inbound direction tested too?

Should the merge also carry strreset_inseq and peer.addip_serial, or
re-derive them from new->peer.i.initial_tsn the way sctp_process_init() does?

> +	asoc->peer.intl_capable = new->peer.intl_capable;

[Severity: High]

This bit selects the chunk operation set, and the merge copies the bit
without re-selecting it.  The only place asoc->stream.si is derived from it
is sctp_stream_interleave_init(), reached from sctp_stream_init():

net/sctp/stream_interleave.c:sctp_stream_interleave_init() {
	...
	stream->si = asoc->peer.intl_capable ? &sctp_stream_interleave_1
					     : &sctp_stream_interleave_0;
}

In a collision that ran on the temporary association.  Neither branch of
sctp_assoc_update() refreshes it on the survivor: sctp_stream_update() copies
out/in/outcnt/incnt and leaves stream->si alone, sctp_stream_clear() only
zeroes mid/mid_uo, and the COOKIE_ECHOED case calls neither.  asoc->frag_point
is not recomputed either, although normal negotiation pairs the two:

net/sctp/sm_make_chunk.c:sctp_process_init() {
	...
	if (sctp_stream_init(&asoc->stream, ...))
		goto clean_up;

	/* Update frag_point when stream_interleave may get changed. */
	sctp_assoc_update_frag_point(asoc);
}

So after the merge peer.intl_capable is 1 while stream.si is still
&sctp_stream_interleave_0.  The INIT-ACK extension list is built from
peer.intl_capable, so the peer is told I-DATA is in use.  What happens when
it sends one?

net/sctp/sm_statefuns.c:sctp_eat_data() {
	...
	if (!asoc->stream.si->validate_data(chunk))
		return SCTP_IERROR_PROTO_VIOLATION;
}

sctp_validate_data() returns false for anything that is not SCTP_CID_DATA,
and the callers turn SCTP_IERROR_PROTO_VIOLATION into
sctp_sf_abort_violation().  Can a peer that legitimately follows the
negotiated extension abort the association this way?

There is a second effect in the send path, which branches directly on the
bit rather than on stream.si:

net/sctp/stream_sched.c:sctp_sched_dequeue_done() {
	...
	if (!list_is_last(&ch->frag_list, &ch->msg->chunks) &&
	    !q->asoc->peer.intl_capable) {
		/* pin stream.out_curr */
	}
}

With the bit set but plain DATA chunks being dequeued, stream.out_curr is no
longer pinned mid-message.  Can the PRIO/RR schedulers then interleave
fragments of different streams on the wire?  Before this patch the survivor
kept intl_capable at 0 and the pin was taken.

The reverse case looks reachable too: a restart where the new INIT no longer
advertises I-DATA now clears the bit while stream.si stays
&sctp_stream_interleave_1, leaving I-DATA and I-FORWARD-TSN installed for a
peer that did not negotiate them.

Would calling sctp_stream_interleave_init() and sctp_assoc_update_frag_point()
on the surviving association after the copy address both directions?

> +	asoc->peer.ipv4_address = new->peer.ipv4_address;
> +	asoc->peer.ipv6_address = new->peer.ipv6_address;
>  	asoc->peer.i = new->peer.i;

[Severity: Medium]

This is a pre-existing issue and not introduced by this patch, but since the
copy block is being extended: peer.adaptation_ind is still not carried.

sctp_process_param() records the peer's Adaptation Layer Indication on the
association it is processing, which in a collision is the temporary one:

net/sctp/sm_make_chunk.c:sctp_process_param() {
	...
	case SCTP_PARAM_ADAPTATION_LAYER_IND:
		asoc->peer.adaptation_ind = ntohl(param.aind->adaptation_ind);
}

and the completion path reads the survivor's copy right after the merge:

net/sctp/sm_statefuns.c:sctp_sf_do_dupcook_b() {
	...
	if (asoc->peer.adaptation_ind)
		sctp_add_cmd_sf(commands, SCTP_CMD_ADAPTATION_IND, SCTP_NULL());
}

For a COOKIE_WAIT survivor the field is still 0, so is the
SCTP_ADAPTATION_INDICATION notification dropped even though the peer asked
for it, and on a restart is an older non-zero value reported instead of the
new one?  asoc->c = new->c does update c.adaptation_ind, but nothing copies
that into peer.adaptation_ind after the merge.

Note this field is a separate __u32 rather than part of the bitfield block
the changelog calls "the rest of the block", so it is outside what the patch
sets out to fix.
