wifi: cfg80211: allow IR on a channel the wiphy already operates on

This patch adds a same-channel exemption to cfg80211_ir_permissive_chan().
If any connected station or beaconing AP on the wiphy already operates on
the requested channel, IR is allowed, and this check runs before the
CONFIG_CFG80211_REG_RELAX_NO_IR / REGULATORY_ENABLE_RELAX_NO_IR gate. The
patch also adds NL80211_IFTYPE_AP to the relaxation iftype whitelist, so
hostapd can start an AP on the station's channel on LAR devices such as
iwlwifi.

[Severity: High]
The wdev being validated is itself on rdev->wiphy.wdev_list. Won't a
beaconing AP always match its own ap.chandef.chan here?

If so, every relax = true re-check of a running AP on its own primary
channel returns true. cfg80211_reg_check_beaconing() then drops
IEEE80211_CHAN_NO_IR from prohibited_flags.

One path affected is regulatory re-validation:

reg_leave_invalid_chans_wk()
  reg_wdev_chan_valid()  (iftype = AP, chandef = ap.chandef, relax = true)
    cfg80211_reg_check_beaconing()
      cfg80211_ir_permissive_chan()  -> matches itself, returns true

Suppose the AP's channel becomes NO_IR after a country IE, a user hint, a
LAR update, or clearing the indoor setting. Would cfg80211_leave_locked()
then never be called for this AP?

The same self-approval seems to apply in two more places:

  - __nl80211_set_channel(), for a beaconing AP that keeps its primary
    channel
  - the "recheck beaconing is permitted with possibly changed power type"
    check in nl80211_set_beacon()

For example, a 6 GHz AP started as VLP on a NO_IR channel is only allowed
there through IEEE80211_CHAN_ALLOW_6GHZ_VLP_AP. Could it then switch its
beacon to LPI or SP?

None of this needs a station or a second interface. It also runs before
the opt-in gate, so it affects every driver and every build.

[Severity: High]
The exemption is justified by the station already radiating on the
channel. What happens to an AP started this way after that station
disconnects?

__cfg80211_disconnected() calls cfg80211_schedule_channels_check(), but
that only schedules a re-check for some drivers:

net/wireless/nl80211.c:cfg80211_schedule_channels_check() {
    ...
	if (wdev->iftype == NL80211_IFTYPE_STATION &&
	    (wiphy_ext_feature_isset(wiphy,
				     NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_DFS_CONCURRENT) ||
	    (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_CFG80211_REG_RELAX_NO_IR) &&
	     wiphy->regulatory_flags & REGULATORY_ENABLE_RELAX_NO_IR)))
		reg_check_channels();
}

For the drivers this exemption newly covers, no re-check runs. When a
re-check does run, the AP validates against itself, as described above.
Could the AP then keep beaconing on the NO_IR channel with no authorized
master?

This branch also makes any beaconing AP an anchor for any requested
iftype. Could more APs, P2P GOs or TDLS off-channel links then be chained
onto the channel?

The existing cfg80211_ir_permissive_check_wdev() only allows a GO to
anchor another GO. It guards that case with !INDOOR_ONLY, and its comment
says this is because the station relied on may have disconnected:

	if (iftype == NL80211_IFTYPE_P2P_GO &&
	    wdev->iftype == NL80211_IFTYPE_P2P_GO &&
	    wdev->links[link_id].ap.beacon_interval &&
	    !(chan->flags & IEEE80211_CHAN_INDOOR_ONLY))

Should the new AP anchor have a similar restriction?

Also, this loop ignores P2P_CLIENT and P2P_GO. reg_wdev_chan_valid()
handles those together with STATION and AP.

[Severity: High]
Only the 20 MHz control channel is compared here. On a match,
cfg80211_reg_check_beaconing() drops IEEE80211_CHAN_NO_IR for the whole
chandef:

	return _cfg80211_reg_can_beacon(wiphy, chandef, cfg->iftype,
					check_no_ir ? IEEE80211_CHAN_NO_IR : 0,
					permitting_flags);

_cfg80211_chandef_usable() then checks every subchannel against that
reduced mask.

Take a station associated at 20 MHz on channel 36. Hostapd then starts an
80 MHz AP on 36-48, where 40, 44 and 48 are NO_IR. Wouldn't all of those
subchannels pass?

An existing AP could also widen itself through __nl80211_set_channel().
That function only requires chandef.chan == cur_chan, and the AP then
matches itself here.

This early return also comes before the IEEE80211_CHAN_IR_CONCURRENT and
regulatory_indoor_allowed() checks. Does it then apply in these cases too?

  - wiphys with a fully known regdomain
  - NO_IR plus INDOOR_ONLY channels without an indoor declaration
  - 6 GHz channels where NO_IR means AP operation is not allowed for this
    device

The commit message says:

  Meanwhile starting an AP on the exact channel the wiphy is already
  operating a station connection on adds nothing new from a regulatory
  point of view: the device is already initiating radiation there.

Does that premise hold? A station transmits under the control of its
master, but an AP is itself the master. At wider widths it also occupies
channels the station never used.

[Severity: High]
The new loop returns true before this gate and before the iftype
whitelist. Doesn't that make NO_IR relaxation unconditional for every
kernel build, every driver and every iftype?

Before this patch, a kernel built without CONFIG_CFG80211_REG_RELAX_NO_IR
always returned false here. The Kconfig help for that option says:

  - it depends on CFG80211_CERTIFICATION_ONUS and is not enabled by
    default
  - relaxations apply only to drivers that declare support
  - a GO started due to the relaxation should not allow connections from
    non P2P clients

With the new loop, hostapd can start an AP on a NO_IR channel as soon as
a station is associated there (passive association is allowed):

nl80211_start_ap()  (relax = true)
  cfg80211_reg_check_beaconing()
    cfg80211_ir_permissive_chan()
      -> new loop matches current_bss->pub.channel, returns true
    _cfg80211_reg_can_beacon(..., prohibited_flags = 0, ...)

The iftype whitelist is skipped as well. reg_wdev_chan_valid() re-checks
ADHOC and MESH_POINT with relax = true, so those would also get NO_IR
waived when they share a channel with a station or AP.

Separately, the commit message says:

  - cfg80211_ir_permissive_chan() gates on the driver opting in via
    REGULATORY_ENABLE_RELAX_NO_IR (iwlwifi does not), and its iftype
    whitelist covers P2P-GO/STATION/P2P-CLIENT but not AP;

Is that accurate? Both iwlwifi op-modes appear to set the flag:

drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/mvm/mac80211.c:iwl_mvm_mac_setup_register() {
    ...
	hw->wiphy->regulatory_flags |= REGULATORY_ENABLE_RELAX_NO_IR;
    ...
}

drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/mld/mld.c:
	wiphy->regulatory_flags |= REGULATORY_ENABLE_RELAX_NO_IR;

So on the test device, the gate that blocked the AP seems to be the
Kconfig option. The commit message doesn't say that the patch bypasses
it.

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but this comment no longer matches the whitelist
below, which now includes NL80211_IFTYPE_AP.

A few other comments in net/wireless/chan.c look stale too:

  - The header comment of cfg80211_ir_permissive_chan() only describes
    the IR_CONCURRENT plus associated station rule and the indoor rule.
    The new early return needs neither.
  - The new block's comment talks about starting an AP, but the loop
    never reads iftype.
  - The comment in cfg80211_reg_check_beaconing() still says only a
    GO/STA can IR on NO_IR channels, and only when such relaxations are
    enabled.

[Severity: Medium]
Does adding NL80211_IFTYPE_AP here conflict with the uAPI documentation
for NL80211_FREQUENCY_ATTR_IR_CONCURRENT?

include/uapi/linux/nl80211.h:
 *	the guidance of an authorized master, i.e., setting up a GO or TDLS
 *	off-channel while the device is also connected to an AP with DFS and
 *	radar detection on the UNII band (it is up to user-space, i.e.,
 *	wpa_supplicant to perform the required verifications). Using this
 *	attribute for IR is disallowed for master interfaces (IBSS, AP).

IEEE80211_CHAN_IR_CONCURRENT takes its meaning from that attribute. With
AP in the whitelist, cfg80211_ir_permissive_check_wdev() returns true for
an AP when a station is connected on the same channel or in the same UNII
band.

This change also opens the indoor branch to AP:

	if (regulatory_indoor_allowed() &&
	    (chan->flags & IEEE80211_CHAN_INDOOR_ONLY))
		return true;

Through nl80211_start_ap() (relax = true), that seems to allow a
standalone AP on NO_IR plus INDOOR_ONLY channels, with no station
connected at the same time.

The commit message only describes the IR_CONCURRENT case. Was the indoor
expansion intended?
