rds_rdma_cm_event_handler_cmn() picks the connection up from
cm_id->context, which carries no reference, and holds c_cm_lock - a
mutex that lives in the connection's path array - across the transport
callbacks.  Before this series that was already a use-after-free
whenever a callback destroyed the connection, since rds_conn_destroy()
freed it synchronously and the handler's mutex_unlock() ran on freed
memory; the one such callback, rds_ib_cm_connect_complete() on a
protocol version below 3.1, has meanwhile been switched to
rds_conn_drop() by commit f97d8c7bab78 ("rds: ib: use rds_conn_drop()
on protocol version mismatch"), which also removed the deadlock that
destroy took on c_cm_lock.

Now that a connection is freed by its last reference, none of the
callbacks the handler dispatches drops a reference on the connection
it was handed: the version-mismatch path only drops the connection,
and rds_ib_cm_handle_connect() puts the reference rds_conn_create()
gave it, on a connection the listener's cm_id never pointed at.  What
can reach zero while an event is in flight are the holders outside
the handler - the destroy's initial reference, a socket's cache, a
parent's c_passive, an inc.  Today the shutdown pass destroys the
cm_id, and rdma_destroy_id() waits for a running handler, before the
initial reference is dropped, so every event is ordered ahead of the
free; the pin is defensive, keeping the handler correct without
leaning on that ordering.  Take a reference for the duration of the
handler, and ignore the event if the connection is already at zero
references rather than handle it.

rds_ib_cm_initiate_connect() and rds_ib_cm_handle_connect() get a
defensive check of the same kind.  A destroy that began while the
address and route were resolving either waits on c_cm_lock behind the
ROUTE_RESOLVED handler - and its shutdown pass then tears down
whatever the handler set up, QP, cm_id and device reference alike - or
has already destroyed the id, in which case no event for it reaches
the handler.  On the passive side a quiesced connection is unhashed,
so rds_conn_create() cannot hand it to a connect request, and the
listeners are stopped before any IB connection is destroyed at unload.
Neither path is reachable today, then; both functions nevertheless
decline to set up a QP, or install a new cm_id, on a connection whose
destroy has begun, so that the contract does not rest on that
ordering.  rds_ib_cm_initiate_connect() returns success when it
declines: the id is still ic->i_cm_id, for the shutdown to destroy,
and a non-zero return would have the rdma_cm destroy it instead.  An
unload that begins after the check has passed is covered by
rds_ib_add_conn() refusing a device that rds_ib_dev_shutdown() has
marked.
