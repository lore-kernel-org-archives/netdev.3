This doesn't seem to break the NIPA case (at least I can see the
'contest test' output is not SKIP, but PASS for the openvswitch.sh).
I'm not sure about the suggestion to change the script in
tools/testing/selftests/net/openvswitch/openvswitch.sh to do a config
merge.  It isn't out-of-tree or anything, and seems like that would
create confusing git state (and not desirable from my end) - the
upstream test would leave a modified, tracked file.  Was that your
suggestion?  Or do you mean NIPA itself (but I think it already just
uses the top-level config).

The config change itself looks fine to me.

Well, it is testing path MTU across multiple topologies, so it isn't
really an openvswitch specific test.  Just one that happens to use
openvswitch in one of the test cases.
