net/rds: restrict the rdma_cm ids to IB devices

This restricts the three rdma_cm ids RDS creates (the listener, the
per-connection id, and the probe id in rds_ib_laddr_check_cm()) to
RDMA_NODE_IB_CA via rdma_restrict_node_type(), so the listener is only
installed on IB devices and address resolution can only pick one.

A couple of questions about the commit message and about what the handler
actually does today.

The message says:

    With that, the connect-request rejection for non-IB devices in the
    event handler becomes unreachable; it stays as the last line of
    defence and is what stable kernels without the new API rely on.

[Severity: High]
Is there actually a rejection in the event handler?  Looking at
rds_rdma_cm_event_handler_cmn() in net/rds/rdma_transport.c, trans is
declared without an initializer and only ever assigned on the IB path:

	struct rds_connection *conn = cm_id->context;
	struct rds_transport *trans;
	...
	if (cm_id->device->node_type == RDMA_NODE_IB_CA)
		trans = &rds_ib_transport;

There is no else arm, and no error return.  The switch then dereferences
trans unconditionally:

	case RDMA_CM_EVENT_CONNECT_REQUEST:
		ret = trans->cm_handle_connect(cm_id, event, isv6);

with the same pattern for trans->cm_initiate_connect() under
RDMA_CM_EVENT_ROUTE_RESOLVED and trans->cm_connect_complete() under
RDMA_CM_EVENT_ESTABLISHED.

So on a device whose node_type is not RDMA_NODE_IB_CA, does the handler
reject anything, or does it make an indirect call through an uninitialized
stack slot?  git blame points at dcdede0406d30e ("RDS: Drop stale iWARP
RDMA transport"), which removed the

	else
		trans = &rds_iw_transport;

arm without adding a bail-out.

If that is right, then the sentence quoted above describes the opposite of
what the code does, and the trees the message says are covered have no
mitigation at all.  siw_device_create() in
drivers/infiniband/sw/siw/siw_main.c sets

	base_dev->node_type = RDMA_NODE_RNIC;

and before this patch cma_listen_on_dev() installed the RDS listener on
that device, so a remote peer connecting to the RDS port reaches the
CONNECT_REQUEST case above.

Would it make sense to also add the handler-side bail-out, something like

	if (!trans)
		return -EINVAL;

so that the "last line of defence" the message refers to exists, and so
there is something minimal to backport to trees without
rdma_restrict_node_type()?  The cm_id->device->node_type load itself is
also unguarded, while net/rds/ib.c still tests !cm_id->device.

[Severity: High]
The message describes this test as follows:

    the address check's bind fails outright on anything else (its
    explicit node_type test now only guards against a device with no
    node type at all)

Is that accurate?  Once restricted_node_type is set on the id,
cma_acquire_dev_by_src_ip() in drivers/infiniband/core/cma.c skips every
candidate device by node type:

		if (id_priv->restricted_node_type != RDMA_NODE_UNSPECIFIED &&
		    id_priv->restricted_node_type != cma_dev->device->node_type)
			continue;

Since RDMA_NODE_UNSPECIFIED is also filtered there, the
cm_id->device->node_type != RDMA_NODE_IB_CA half of the test in
rds_ib_laddr_check_cm() looks dead rather than a guard for "no node type
at all"; only the !cm_id->device half can still fire.  Could the
parenthetical be reworded?

[Severity: Low]
This new error path jumps to out and returns ret with ic->i_cm_id
still pointing at the id rdma_create_id() just handed back, and nothing
between here and the return destroys it.  Compare the
rdma_resolve_addr() failure a few lines further down, which does

	rdma_destroy_id(ic->i_cm_id);
	ic->i_cm_id = NULL;

before falling into the same out label, and the other two sites this
patch touches: in rds_ib_laddr_check_cm() the new goto out lands on a
label that calls rdma_destroy_id(cm_id), and in
rds_rdma_listen_init_common() cm_id is still non-NULL at out so it is
destroyed there too.  So this is the one of the three new calls whose
failure leaks the id, i.e. a struct rdma_id_private and its restrack
entry.

In practice it cannot be reached: rdma_restrict_node_type() only
returns -EINVAL for a node type it does not recognise and -EALREADY if
the id is not in RDMA_CM_IDLE, and a freshly created kernel id being
restricted to RDMA_NODE_IB_CA is neither, so this is a structural
defect rather than something a peer or a local user can trigger.

Still, the surrounding code is careful about this, so which way did you
intend it?  Is the connection teardown path (rds_ib_conn_shutdown(),
which destroys ic->i_cm_id when it is set) meant to clean up after a
failed rds_ib_conn_path_connect(), or should this arm mirror the
resolve failure and do the rdma_destroy_id()/NULL itself?  If the
former, the asymmetry with the rdma_resolve_addr() arm immediately
below is confusing enough that it is worth saying so in a comment.

[Severity: Low]
Should this change carry a Fixes: tag, and a note for stable?  The defect
being closed is remotely reachable (the listener was previously installed
on RDMA_NODE_RNIC devices such as siw, and the handler then runs with
trans unassigned), but there is no Fixes: line among the trailers.

The three new calls here, in rds_ib_conn_path_connect() and in
rds_ib_laddr_check_cm() all depend on a760e80e90f5 ("RDMA/core: introduce
rdma_restrict_node_type()"), so an automated backport to a tree without
that commit will not build.  Could the message state either that
a760e80e90f5 is a prerequisite, or that stable should take a minimal
handler-side fix instead?
