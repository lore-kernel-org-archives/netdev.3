net/sched: drr, ets, sfq: skip empty rounds in the deficit-refill dequeue loop

This patch changes the DRR, ETS and SFQ dequeue loops. After a full round
in which no class could dequeue, they now compute how many more rounds are
needed and add that many quanta to every class in one pass, instead of
refilling one quantum per iteration. It follows commit 8f735d64382d to bound
the dequeue cost when a size table inflates packet lengths to 1 MiB.

Closes: https://netdev-ai.bots.linux.dev/sashiko/#/patchset/20260819143213.57401-1-jhs@mojatatu.com

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue and was not introduced by this patch.
cake_dequeue() in net/sched/sch_cake.c seems to have the same
one-quantum-per-visit refill, and no patch in the series changes it.

The later patch "net/sched: fq, fq_codel, fq_pie: skip empty rounds in the
deficit-refill dequeue loop" covers fq, fq_codel and fq_pie. That leaves
cake:

net/sched/sch_cake.c:cake_dequeue() {
    ...
	if (flow->deficit <= 0) {
		...
		WRITE_ONCE(flow->deficit,
			   flow->deficit + cake_get_flow_quantum(b, flow, q->config->flow_mode));
		list_move_tail(&flow->flowchain, &b->old_flows);

		goto retry;
	}
    ...
}

cake_overhead() starts from qdisc_pkt_len(skb). With a root stab of
overhead 1048576, each flow can therefore be left about 1 MiB in deficit
after a single dequeue.

The per-visit quantum is also much smaller than DRR's minimum of 256:

net/sched/sch_cake.c:cake_get_flow_quantum() {
    ...
	return (q->flow_quantum * quantum_div[host_load] +
		get_random_u16()) >> 16;
}

Take the default triple-isolate mode with 1024 bulk flows from one host.
That averages about 1.46 bytes per visit, or about 0.29 bytes with
flow_quantum 300.

Could one cake_dequeue() over 1024 flows at -1 MiB then need roughly 7e8
to 3.7e9 iterations under the root lock with BH disabled? That is well
past the 16384-class DRR case that the commit message describes as a ~1s
stall.

Should this have a Fixes: tag? The commit message says this follows
commit 8f735d64382d ("net/sched: bound qdisc_pkt_len to prevent qdisc
soft lockup"), and that commit carries:

Fixes: 1da177e4c3f4 ("Linux-2.6.12-rc2")

Without a matching tag, stable may take 8f735d64382d without this patch.
8f735d64382d on its own still allows N * 4096 iterations per dequeue.

[Severity: Medium]
scanned is never cleared, so each dequeue gets at most one bulk refill.
Can a child's peeked head change between this scan and the loop's next
visit to that class?

prio_peek() polls every band again on each call:

net/sched/sch_prio.c:prio_peek() {
    ...
	for (prio = 0; prio < q->bands; prio++) {
		struct Qdisc *qdisc = q->queues[prio];
		struct sk_buff *skb = qdisc->ops->peek(qdisc);
		if (skb)
			return skb;
	}
    ...
}

A netem band also decides readiness from a fresh ktime_get_ns() in
netem_dequeue().

Here is an example setup. One DRR class has a PRIO child with a delayed
netem band 0 and a pfifo band 1 that holds a small packet. Every other
class has a 1 MiB head and quantum 256. The scan sees the small packet,
picks rounds=2 and raises every deficit to 1024.

Suppose the netem deadline passes before the loop gets back to the PRIO
class. prio_peek() then returns the 1 MiB netem packet and no class is
eligible. Because scanned is already true, the loop falls back to the
one-quantum path:

		WRITE_ONCE(cl->deficit, cl->deficit + READ_ONCE(cl->quantum));
		list_move_tail(&cl->alist, &q->active);

That costs roughly N * 4091 more iterations.

The commit message says "a dequeue costs O(N)" for DRR/ETS without a
caveat. The follow-up fq patch documents a similar limitation, but this
one does not.

Would clearing scanned and first after a bulk pass avoid this?
ets_qdisc_dequeue() has the same one-shot guard, although there it is
bounded by 16 bands.

[Severity: Medium]
quantum is read once in the scan to compute rounds, then read again here
when the refill is applied. Can it change between the two reads?

drr_change_class() updates an existing class without sch_tree_lock():

net/sched/sch_drr.c:drr_change_class() {
    ...
	if (cl != NULL) {
		...
		if (tb[TCA_DRR_QUANTUM])
			WRITE_ONCE(cl->quantum, quantum);

		return 0;
	}
    ...
}

tc_ctl_tclass() calls cops->change() under RTNL only. It does not take
the qdisc root lock that dequeue holds.

As an example, say the scan computes rounds=1 from a class with quantum
524288, deficit 524288 and a 1 MiB head. A concurrent change then sets
that quantum to 256 before this pass, so the refill adds only 256 and no
class becomes eligible.

Since scanned is already true, would the loop then fall back to about
2047 one-quantum rounds over all N classes?

ets_qdisc_dequeue() and ets_class_change() have the same pattern.
Snapshotting each class's quantum, or taking sch_tree_lock() around the
quantum update, would close this.
