Well, _that_ mostly shouldn't have happened for a long time (since
5.12), though I actually learned yesterday that some android drivers
went to implement things with private ioctls because they (thought they)
needed the RTNL ... so, Android, take with a bag of salt.

Couldn't we remove that today, by just __rtnl_unlock() in that place in
cfg80211? But it's not exported, for good reason, presumably.

But that's also irrelevant, because indeed after my patchset cfg80211
doesn't do that any more:

I have no idea what I'm talking about ;-)

OK so I (likely naively) thought the idea was that most things like
netdev registration/unregistration eventually move to rtnl_net_lock()?
Here are the places that still take RTNL in wifi after the patchset
above:

 - suspend/resume (not entirely sure - it goes to hw restart maybe)
 - hw restart (can unregister netdevs on failures)
 - rate control init in mac80211 (but that can be removed easily)
 - netdev registration
 - netdev unregistration
 - rfkill, to call dev_close()
 - wiphy registration/unregistration (might be possible to disentangle
   now)
 - network namespace destruction/exit
 - wiphy naming, but that can move to cfg80211_mtx now
 - some netlink dumps (related to the naming?)
 - testmode/vendor ... I guess we can't get rid of that,
   but no upstream drivers should have much here
 - interface/wdev start/stop
 - netns moves

(and a couple of places I should just fix).

So mostly that's relatively short-lived (like the wiphy naming stuff) or
related to network/netns maintenance where I'm not sure.

Thanks!
