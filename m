Thanks for bringing up your use case.

Have you looked into alternative solutions such as Receive Side Scaling
(https://docs.kernel.org/networking/scaling.html#rss-receive-side-scaling)?
AFAIK it's not just the crypto performance that makes pcrypt unnecessary
these days, but also the design of the networking layer.

I understand that i.MX6 doesn't have the ARMv8 crypto extensions.
However, surely you could at least use the NEON-optimized GHASH code?
Is there a reason you're not using it?
