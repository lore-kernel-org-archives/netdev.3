Well, the Sashiko comment about removing ip6_route_get_saddr() feels a little bit gaslighting when the next commit is literally removing ip6_route_get_saddr() - but I'm looking at the other ones.  Also forgot to remove the MAINTAINERS line for the documentation file, which I said I'd do.

Will send a v3 in a bit.
