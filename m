You are right on both counts, and the block accounting is correct even thou=
gh
the changelog describing it is not.

The two platforms differ in a way the message flattens into one story:

  platform   Super VCAP blocks   assigned before   LPM block   IS0 loses
  sparx5     10                  0-9, 2 per inst   9           yes
  lan969x    6                   0-4, 1 per inst   5           no

I will update the commit message to reflect the state of things on both spa=
rx5
and lan969x.

>=20

Correct, "IS0" is too broad and the numbers you give are exact. Only the CL=
M-0
instance changes; CLM-1 keeps blocks 6-7 and CLM-2 keeps blocks 4-5, so IS0
goes from six blocks to five rather than losing half of anything.

The affected range is CLM-0's, first_cid SPARX5_VCAP_CID_IS0_L0 through
last_cid SPARX5_VCAP_CID_IS0_L2 - 1, so chains 1000000-1199999. With
SPARX5_IS0_LOOKUPS at 6 and lookups_per_instance at 6 / 3, that instance co=
vers
IS0 lookups 0 and 1, and its address space goes from 6144 to 3072.

I will fold this into the commit message as well.

>=20

Not intentional, and yes, the tc-flower path should reject the LPM chain
explicitly. The LPM VCAP is meant to be system-only, owned by the router, a=
nd
not reachable from tc at all. v3 does that.

Rather than add VCAP_TYPE_LPM arms to those switches, v3 rejects the chain =
up
front, which also means the LPM range stays indistinguishable from a chain =
that
maps to no VCAP.

>=20

Confirmed. The goto target should be cleanup_vcap. No extra unwind code is
needed, because sparx5_vcap_deinit() already does the right thing: it
NULL-guards ctrl, iterates ctrl->list with list_for_each_entry_safe so
a partial list is fine, frees all three cache buffers plus the admin via
sparx5_vcap_admin_free(), then destroys the mutex and frees ctrl. There is
no double-free risk either, since the admin that failed is already freed in=
side
sparx5_vcap_admin_alloc() before it returns ERR_PTR. And cleanup_vcap falls
through to cleanup_ports, so the netdevs are still destroyed.

I would rather not carry that in this series. It is a memory leak on a prob=
e
error path with nothing to do with L3 routing, it is pre-existing and belon=
gs
in the net tree.

Yes on all of it, and the +1 form is the one to use. The range is inclusive=
 so
its length is last_valid_addr - first_valid_addr + 1, the helper clears
MV_SIZE + 1 addresses as you say, and the result is that first_valid_addr
through last_valid_addr - 1 get cleared while last_valid_addr does not. 307=
19
on sparx5 and 18431 on lan969x are right.

Prefer last_valid_addr - first_valid_addr + 1 over
cfg->blocks * SUPER_VCAP_BLK_SIZE. The latter is only correct for the three
Super VCAP types and would be wrong for ES0 and ES2, which derive the range
from cfg->count, and sparx5_vcap_block_init() has no cfg argument anyway. N=
o
overflow risk from the +1 either: MV_SIZE is 16 bits and the widest instanc=
e is
two Super VCAP blocks, 6144 addresses.


The scope is wider than LPM or even sparx5. Every VCAP instance on both
platforms is affected, since the ES0 and ES2 arms reach the same helper thr=
ough
the same block_init. And lan966x_vcap_block_init() has the identical expres=
sion
feeding a __lan966x_vcap_range_init() that also does MV_SIZE_SET(count - 1)=
, so
lan966x has the same bug.


As with the sparx5_vcap_init() leak, I would rather not carry this in the
series. It is pre-existing, it affects lan966x as well as sparx5, and it wa=
nts
a fixes tag and the net tree.
