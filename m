net: stmmac: keep DMA configurations at stable addresses

This commit turns priv->dma_conf from an embedded struct into a pointer
to the allocated DMA configuration. The goal is to keep RXQ metadata
registered with XDP and AF_XDP at a stable address. Per-queue MSI
handlers now use priv->channel[] as their cookie. stmmac_quiesce()
drains transmitters and NAPI with synchronize_net() before cancelling
the TX hrtimers. On success the open and MTU paths free the old
configuration, and on failure they restore it.

[Severity: Medium]
Now that dma_conf is a separate allocation that gets freed on reopen,
can the EEE software LPI timer read a freed configuration here? The
timer path is:

stmmac_eee_ctrl_timer()
  stmmac_try_to_start_sw_lpi()
    stmmac_eee_tx_busy()
      tx_q = &priv->dma_conf->tx_queue[queue];

No lock or RCU protects the priv->dma_conf load.

__stmmac_release() calls phylink_stop() first, and that reaches
stmmac_mac_disable_tx_lpi():

    priv->eee_sw_timer_en = false;
    timer_delete_sync(&priv->eee_ctrl_timer);

NAPI is still running at that point. stmmac_tx_clean() checks the flag
without a lock before it re-arms the timer:

    if (priv->eee_sw_timer_en && !priv->tx_path_in_lpi_mode)
        stmmac_restart_sw_lpi_timer(priv);

Suppose that check passes just before the flag is cleared. Then
mod_timer() can run after timer_delete_sync() has returned. Nothing in
stmmac_quiesce() cancels eee_ctrl_timer again.

Next, suppose the callback loads the old priv->dma_conf before
__stmmac_open() stores the new one, and is then delayed (for example,
preempted in the timer softirq thread on PREEMPT_RT). It would then
dereference tx_queue[] after kfree(old_conf) in stmmac_change_mtu() or
stmmac_open(). Before this patch the configuration was embedded in
priv, so the worst case was a stale read.

Later in the series, stmmac_reconfigure_mtu() adds
timer_delete_sync(&priv->eee_ctrl_timer) after stmmac_quiesce(). The
ethtool ring and channel paths still seem to lack it:

stmmac_reinit_ringparam() / stmmac_reinit_queues()
  __stmmac_release()
  stmmac_reopen()
    __stmmac_open()
    kfree(old_conf)

The close/open path also seems to lack it. Should the EEE timer also be
cancelled on those paths after NAPI is quiesced?

stmmac_features_check(), the ndo_features_check callback, calls this.
Can it read priv->dma_conf after the old configuration has been freed?

netif_skb_features() is called from paths that neither
netif_device_detach() nor stopped TX queues exclude:

- tbf_segment() in net/sched/sch_tbf.c, and similarly taprio, cake,
  netem and dualpi2
- ip_finish_output_gso() and its IPv6 counterpart
- validate_xmit_skb() in sch_direct_xmit(), before the stopped-queue
  check

In stmmac_change_mtu(), the only synchronize_net() is the one inside
__stmmac_release(), and it runs before the pointer swap:

stmmac_change_mtu()
  netif_device_detach(dev)
  __stmmac_release(dev)
    stmmac_quiesce()
      synchronize_net()
  __stmmac_open(dev, dma_conf)
    priv->dma_conf = dma_conf;
  kfree(old_conf)

A GSO feature check could load the old pointer after that drain and be
preempted until after kfree(old_conf). It would then read tbs from
freed memory.

The same ordering seems to remain at the end of the series. In
stmmac_reconfigure_mtu(), synchronize_net() runs before
priv->dma_conf = new_conf, followed by kfree(old_conf). stmmac_reopen()
does the same for ring and channel changes.

Is a grace period needed between publishing the new configuration and
freeing the old one?

[Severity: High]
The commit message says:

  Drain transmitters and NAPI poll tails before cancelling TX timers so
  a late rearm cannot outlive the configuration containing the timer.

Can a TX hard-error interrupt restart transmitters after that drain?
__stmmac_release() runs stmmac_quiesce() and frees the IRQs only
afterwards:

    stmmac_quiesce(priv);
    ...
    stmmac_free_irq(dev, REQ_IRQ_ERR_ALL, 0);
    stmmac_stop_all_dma(priv);
    free_dma_desc_resources(priv, priv->dma_conf);

In that window, stmmac_msi_intr_tx() calls stmmac_tx_err(), which ends
with:

    netif_tx_wake_queue(netdev_get_tx_queue(priv->dev, chan));

Once a queue is woken, stack transmitters can enter stmmac_xmit() or
stmmac_tso_xmit() again. They would be using the old configuration
while free_dma_desc_resources() frees its rings, and while this
kfree(old_conf) frees the struct itself.

Two later commits in the series deal with this:

- "net: stmmac: account for failed live XDP reopening" adds a second
  stmmac_stop_tx_queues() after stmmac_free_irq() in
  __stmmac_release().
- "net: stmmac: retain DMA resources across MTU changes" disables IRQ
  handling in stmmac_reconfigure_mtu() before replacing the
  configuration.

At this patch, though, can the old configuration still be in use after
kfree(old_conf)?

[Severity: Medium]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but stmmac_xdp_release()
still cancels the TX hrtimers right after stmmac_disable_all_queues().
It does not run the synchronize_net() that stmmac_quiesce() now uses.
Can a NAPI poll tail re-arm a timer after this cancel?

After napi_complete_done() clears SCHED, stmmac_tx_timer_arm() can see
napi_is_scheduled() == false and call hrtimer_start(). stmmac_xdp_open()
then calls hrtimer_setup() on the same txtimer, which could
re-initialize an armed hrtimer.

Later in the series, "net: stmmac: account for failed live XDP
reopening" addresses this by making stmmac_xdp_release() call
stmmac_quiesce().

[Severity: Medium]
Is the af_xdp_zc_qps bit a strong enough guard here? In
stmmac_xdp_enable_pool(), the sequence is:

    set_bit(queue, priv->af_xdp_zc_qps);
    ...
    stmmac_enable_rx_queue(priv, queue);
    stmmac_enable_tx_queue(priv, queue);
    napi_enable(&ch->rxtx_napi);
    err = stmmac_xsk_wakeup(priv->dev, queue, XDP_WAKEUP_RX);

Both enable helpers return void. If they fail, dma_rx, buf_pool and
xsk_pool are left NULL.

If both queue re-enables fail, the old check returned -EINVAL. The new
check lets NAPI run stmmac_rx_zc() on a NULL ring and pool.

This seems to go away later in the series with "net: stmmac: use the
tracked datapath restart for XSK pool changes". That commit switches to
stmmac_xdp_release()/stmmac_xdp_open() and clears the bit when the
reopen fails.
