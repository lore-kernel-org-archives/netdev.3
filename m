selftests: dpll: add concurrency stress tests

This adds two tests to dpll_stress.sh. One registers and unregisters
dpllsim devices from several background workers at once. The other
keeps several devices with many pins live and checks that each one is
visible on netlink.

The workers clean up from their own exit trap, and cleanup() stops
recorded workers and shell jobs before it removes their devices by name.

[Severity: Medium]
Does bash really leave the pid unreaped until the wait below? Bash reaps
exited background children itself. It does this from its SIGCHLD handler
and from waitpid(-1) whenever it waits for a foreground command. It keeps
their status in its bgpids table for a later wait.

pids_gone() runs seq, $(sed ...) and sleep 0.1 on every pass. A worker
that exits after the SIGTERM can therefore be reaped, and its pid freed,
before this loop sends SIGKILL to every entry of pids[]. The loop does
not check pid_running() first.

test_concurrent_workers() makes the window wider:

	for pid in "${BACKGROUND_PIDS[@]}"; do
		wait "$pid" || failed=1
	done
	BACKGROUND_PIDS=()

Workers that finish early are reaped right away, but they stay in
BACKGROUND_PIDS until the last wait returns. Suppose a harness timeout or
Ctrl-C arrives while the parent is still waiting on a slower worker.
cleanup() then sends SIGTERM and later SIGKILL, as root, to those stale
pids.

If one of those pids was handed out again after a pid-space wrap, could
this kill an unrelated process?

pid_running() relies on kill -0 and /proc/<pid>/stat, so a reused pid
also looks like a live worker. In that case pids_gone() would spin for
the full five seconds and log a false "worker N did not exit".

[Severity: Low]
Does the forced kill above reach the external helpers that a worker runs?
In dpll_lib.sh, dpllsim_create_device() and dpllsim_add_pin() create the
configfs entries with an external mkdir. dpllsim_delete_device() removes
them with an external rmdir.

The commit message describes a worker "stuck in the kernel". Take the
case where a worker's mkdir blocks in configfs. Bash holds back the
worker's TERM trap until the foreground child returns. kill -KILL then
kills only the subshell, and the mkdir child keeps running as an orphan.

The second pids_gone() and pid_running() check only the subshell pid.
The worker therefore counts as gone and is reaped, and "worker $pid did
not exit, giving up" is never logged.

cleanup() then runs delete_worker_devices() and dpll_lib_cleanup() while
the orphan is still busy. If its mkdir completes afterwards, can a
dpllsim device or pin directory appear after the last removal pass and
be leaked?

The in-flight mkdir would also keep the configfs mount busy, so the
unmount in dpll_lib_cleanup() may fail.

This seems to contradict this part of the commit message:

  "whatever a killed worker left behind can be removed by name, at the
  end of the test and from the cleanup handler"

Would it help to start each worker in its own process group and signal
the whole group, or to track the helper processes?

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but is "maximum devices" the right name for this test?
dpllsim has no limit on the number of devices. Its only per-device limit
is DPLLSIM_MAX_PINS:

drivers/dpll/dpllsim/core.c:dpllsim_pins_make_item() {
    ...
	if (list_count_nodes(&sim->pin_list) >= DPLLSIM_MAX_PINS)
		return ERR_PTR(-ENOSPC);
    ...
}

By default the test creates 5 devices with 10 pins each. It never
reaches that limit, and it never checks that a pin beyond the limit is
rejected. The comment above STRESS_PINS_PER_DEVICE mentions the 128 pin
limit, but the default is well below it.

The visibility check also only looks up the devices with
dpll_device_wait_by_clock_id(). It does not check their pins, so the
test would still pass if the pins of these many-pin devices did not
appear on netlink.

Could the test be renamed, or extended to cover the pin limit and to
check that the pins are visible?
