The program is stored only after it passed the classic verifier, and a
program that is refused later, when it is built, only makes the attach fail:
nothing is left half-installed, and TUNATTACHFILTER can be reissued with a
valid program. Building it once in tun_attach_filter() when there are no
queues would just move the same failure earlier in the ioctl; it would not
make the program installable. The commit message sentence is vacuous in that
case, not wrong: the intent is that a failed build does not replace the saved
program, not that the stored copy has necessarily been built.

This is not a state introduced here. Before this series the same failure ran
tun_detach_filter(tun, i), which also left queues 0..i-1 without a filter,
queues i..n-1 on the old program, and cleared filter_attached while
tun->fprog already held the new header. What this series changes is that
tun->fprog, tun->fprog_kern and filter_attached keep describing the program
queues i..n-1 still run, so a later attach retries it instead of silently
starting without a filter.

Rebuilding from tun->fprog_kern would not remove the failure:
__sk_attach_prog() uncharges the old sk_filter as soon as the replacement is
installed, so queues 0..i-1 no longer hold it, and the rebuild is a new
bpf_prog_create() on the path where that allocation, the optmem charge or
the JIT limit has just failed. It needs a fallback of its own. Building and
charging every program before swapping any of them in would require
splitting __sk_attach_prog(), which is a filter core change, not something to
mix into this fix.

Both are error paths of TUNATTACHFILTER with no corruption outside the
device, so I would leave them as they are.
