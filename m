selftests: net: add ioam6 ECMP test (RFC 9486 C2)

This adds ioam6_ecmp.sh. The test checks that, with hash policy 0, the
ECMP nexthop chosen for a packet carrying IOAM options is the same as
for the packet without them. It covers a transit node forwarding
inline-inserted IOAM Hop-by-Hop packets, and an encapsulating node
doing the ioam6 encap re-lookup with a plain ip6ip6 tunnel as the
baseline.

[Severity: Low]
Is "tunnel dst = original dst" accurate here? The commit message says
the same thing:

  - encapsulating node re-lookup: the forwarder itself encapsulates
    (ioam6 encap mode, tunnel dst equal to the original dst) over a
    multipath route, with a plain ip6ip6 tunnel as the
    identical-packet-without-IOAM baseline.

The script sends to 2001:db8:3::2, but set_beta_ioam_encap() installs
this route:

  2001:db8:3::2/128 encap ioam6 mode encap ... tundst 2001:db8:2:1::2

So the tunnel dst is not the original dst. The topology comment further
down describes this correctly.

If the tunnel dst really were the original dst, the re-lookup would
resolve back to the same ioam6 route:

net/ipv6/ioam6_iptunnel.c:ioam6_output() {
    ...
		if (orig_dst->lwtstate == dst->lwtstate)
			dst_cache_set_ip6(&ilwt->cache,
					  &ilwt->null_rt.dst, &fl6.saddr);
    ...
}

In that case orig_output would be used and the multipath route would
never be consulted.

The ip6ip6 baseline is also not an identical packet on the wire.
ip6_tnl_xmit() pushes an encap-limit Destination Options header when
encap_limit >= 0, and it sets the flow label with ip6_make_flowlabel()
after the route lookup. Only the hash inputs at beta's lookup match.

Could the commit message and this header comment be updated to match
what the test actually does?

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but is "for a few seconds" accurate? ip6_tnl_xmit()
reads the cache with dst_cache_get(&t->dst_cache), and
dst_cache_per_cpu_get() only drops an entry in two cases:

net/core/dst_cache.c:dst_cache_per_cpu_get() {
    ...
	if (unlikely(!time_after(idst->refresh_ts,
				 READ_ONCE(dst_cache->reset_ts)) ||
		     (READ_ONCE(dst->obsolete) && !dst->ops->check(dst, idst->cookie)))) {
    ...
}

That means an explicit dst_cache_reset(), or an obsolete dst that fails
->check(). There is no time-based expiry, so a cached outer dst can
stay indefinitely.

Recreating the tunnel for every seed is still the right workaround. The
comment, though, could lead someone to replace the recreation with a
sleep.

[Severity: Medium]
What happens on a kernel or iproute2 that supports ioam6 inline and
encap modes but not the tunsrc attribute? The compat check in MAIN
only probes inline mode, so it passes, and setup_tunnel() succeeds.

This route install would then fail on every seed, and run_scenario()
takes this path:

		if ! $ioam; then
			RET=$ksft_fail
			log_test "$desc (ioam route setup failed, seed $seed)"

The result is 12 hard FAILs instead of a SKIP. ioam6.sh already treats
tunsrc as a feature under test.

Is the tunsrc pin needed at all? Without it, ioam6_do_encap() calls
ipv6_dev_get_saddr() on the original dst device (veth1), which should
pick 2001:db8:2:1::1 anyway.

[Severity: Low]
Should this route add check its return value? If it fails, beta still
has the connected 2001:db8:2:1::/64 prefix on veth1, so all traffic to
2001:db8:2:1::2 leaves through veth1 and arrives on gamma's veth0.

measure_link() would then return "A" for both variants on every seed.
run_scenario() would report PASS even though no ECMP route exists.

Adding "|| return 1" here would catch this.

[Severity: Low]
Can this unload an ip6_tunnel module the test did not load? Consider
lsmod being unavailable or failing while modprobe works, with
ip6_tunnel already loaded:

  - the first grep fails;
  - modprobe ip6_tunnel succeeds as a no-op;
  - grep ip6tnl0 matches the existing fallback device in the init
    netns;
  - ip6tnl_loaded=1 is set.

cleanup() then runs:

		modprobe -r ip6_tunnel &>/dev/null

This removes the module if nothing else is using it.

When ip6_tunnel is built in, lsmod does not list it either, so
ip6tnl_loaded=1 is set in that case too. The later modprobe -r then
fails harmlessly. ioam6.sh uses the same heuristic.

[Severity: Low]
Should tools/testing/selftests/net/config be updated for this test?
fib_multipath_hash_seed only exists with CONFIG_IP_ROUTE_MULTIPATH.
That option depends on CONFIG_IP_ADVANCED_ROUTER, neither has a
default, and neither is in the net selftests config fragment.

On a kernel built from a minimal base plus that fragment, this test
would always SKIP.

CONFIG_IPV6_TUNNEL, which scenario 2 needs, is not listed explicitly
either. It only gets enabled because CONFIG_IPV6_GRE=m selects it.

> +
> +setup_topology || { log_test_skip "Setup failed."; exit "${EXIT_STATUS}"; }
> +trap cleanup EXIT

[Severity: Medium]
Can this leak ns_alpha, ns_beta and ns_gamma? setup_ns has already
created them by the time setup_topology() returns failure. The trap is
installed only after this exit, so cleanup_all_ns never runs and the
namespaces and any veths stay on the host.

setup_topology() can fail after setup_ns through the veth "|| return 1"
paths. Its exit status is also that of its last command:

	tc -n "$ns_alpha" filter add dev veth0 ingress pref 1 \
                protocol ipv6 flower skip_hw ip_proto icmpv6 type 1 action drop

That command fails on a kernel without cls_flower or act_gact.
setup_ns only cleans up when ip netns add itself fails, and lib.sh
does not install an EXIT trap.

As a side effect, a missing flower is reported as "Setup failed.", and
the later "Cannot install tc flower measurement filters" skip is never
reached for that cause.

Would installing the trap before calling setup_topology() fix this?
