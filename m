RDMA/core: Set the CQ comp_handler after its poll context is set up

This commit reorders __ib_alloc_cq(). The irq_poll or work context and
comp_wq are now initialized before cq->comp_handler is stored, and the CQ
is armed only after the handler is set. The goal is that a completion
event raised right after ops.create_cq() returns no longer finds an
uninitialized poll context.

[Severity: Medium]
This store still runs after dev->ops.create_cq() has returned. By then, can
the driver's EQ dispatch already reach the CQ while comp_handler is still
NULL from rdma_zalloc_drv_obj()?

The driver publishes the CQN during create_cq. For example,
mlx5_core_create_cq()->mlx5_eq_add_cq() inserts it into the radix tree,
efa stores it in dev->cqs_xa, and mthca adds it to cq_table.

Several drivers then call the handler without a NULL check. For example,
in drivers/infiniband/hw/mlx4/cq.c:

static void mlx4_ib_cq_comp(struct mlx4_cq *cq)
{
	struct ib_cq *ibcq = &to_mibcq(cq)->ibcq;
	ibcq->comp_handler(ibcq, ibcq->cq_context);
}

efa_process_comp_eqe() and mthca_cq_completion() do the same, and so does
mlx5_ib_cq_comp() at this commit.

So an early event from a non-conforming device would now be a NULL
function pointer call in irq or tasklet context, instead of scheduling an
uninitialized irq_poll or work. The patch also moves the store later than
before, past rdma_dim_init() (which can do a GFP_KERNEL allocation) and the
whole poll context switch, so the window gets a bit longer.

The commit message says:

    A conforming device raises no event for a new,
    empty CQ, but nothing in the core relies on that.

Doesn't the core now rely on every driver NULL-checking comp_handler?

The later commit "RDMA/mlx5: Ignore completion events for a CQ without a
handler" adds that check to mlx5_ib_cq_comp(), which closes the window for
mlx5. mlx4, efa and mthca still call the handler unconditionally at the end
of the series.

__ib_create_cq() in verbs.c, and the uverbs paths, set the handler before
calling into the driver:

	cq->device = device;
	cq->comp_handler = comp_handler;
	...
	ret = device->ops.create_cq(cq, cq_attr, NULL);

Could __ib_alloc_cq() do the same? That would mean running irq_poll_init(),
INIT_WORK(), the comp_wq store and the comp_handler store before
ops.create_cq(), and keeping only ib_req_notify_cq() for afterwards. The
driver's own publication of the CQ would then provide the ordering.

[Severity: High]
Is program order enough to make the poll context visible before the
handler? The irq_poll_init() stores (memset, INIT_LIST_HEAD, weight, poll),
INIT_WORK() and the cq->comp_wq store are all plain stores. This
comp_handler store is plain too, with no smp_store_release() or smp_wmb().

The reader side has no acquire ordering either:

mlx5 EQ irq
  mlx5_cq_tasklet_cb()
    mlx5_ib_cq_comp()
      ibcq->comp_handler()          <- plain load, indirect call
        ib_cq_completion_softirq()
          irq_poll_sched(&cq->iop)
      or
        ib_cq_completion_workqueue()
          queue_work(cq->comp_wq, &cq->work)

An event that arrives before the CQ is armed gets no ordering from the
doorbell write in ib_req_notify_cq().

On weakly ordered CPUs such as arm64 and POWER, can another CPU see the new
comp_handler before the iop, work or comp_wq stores? In the workqueue
cases, the compiler is also free to reorder the adjacent plain stores to
comp_wq and comp_handler.

If that happens, three things could go wrong:

- The reader schedules an iop whose memset and INIT_LIST_HEAD land after
  its own test_and_set_bit() and list_add_tail(). That corrupts the per-cpu
  irq_poll list.
- irq_poll_softirq() calls a stale NULL iop->poll.
- queue_work() is called with a NULL workqueue.

These are the failures the commit message describes.

Adversarial mode is enabled through cc_platform_has(CC_ATTR_GUEST_MEM_ENCRYPT).
That is true for arm64 realm/pKVM guests and pseries secure guests. The mlx5
UMR CQ allocated in mlx5r_umr_resource_init() with IB_POLL_SOFTIRQ goes
through this path. The plain NULL check that the later commit adds to
mlx5_ib_cq_comp() does not provide acquire ordering.

Would this need smp_store_release() on comp_handler, paired with an acquire
load in the drivers? The other option is to do all of this setup before
ops.create_cq(). Then the driver's publication, such as radix_tree_insert()
under table->lock in mlx5_eq_add_cq(), would order the stores for readers
that look up the CQ.
