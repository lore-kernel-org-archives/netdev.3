net/rds: make rds_destroy_pending() report a connection's own destroy

This patch adds a c_destroy_in_prog flag to struct rds_connection.
rds_conn_destroy() sets it before the unhash and synchronize_rcu()
sequence, and rds_destroy_pending() now tests it first. The patch also
removes the unused RDS_DESTROY_PENDING cp_flags bit and its dead test in
rds_ib_is_unloading().

> One caller escapes both terms.  When the core rds module unloads,
> rds_conn_exit() runs rds_loop_net_exit() first, and unregistering the

[Severity: Medium]
Can this race with rds_cong_queue_updates() actually happen during
rds_exit()?

rds_cong_queue_updates() has only two callers, rds_recv_rcvbuf_delta() and
rds_cong_remove_socket(). Both of them run on behalf of a live rds_sock:

  rds_recv_incoming() (after rds_find_bound()), rds_still_queued(),
  rds_clear_recv_queue() -> rds_recv_rcvbuf_delta()

  rds_release(), rds_cong_monitor() -> rds_cong_remove_socket()

Every rds_sock pins the rds module. rds_proto has:

net/rds/af_rds.c:rds_proto {
	.owner	  = THIS_MODULE,
}

and the socket allocation does:

net/core/sock.c:sk_prot_alloc() {
    ...
	if (!try_module_get(prot->owner))
    ...
}

That reference is only dropped in sk_prot_free(). Also, rds_tcp and
rds_rdma import rds symbols, so they have to be unloaded before rds.

So when rds_exit() -> rds_conn_exit() runs, no RDS sockets should be
left, and only loopback connections remain.

The paragraph also says "the other requeueing sites can likewise re-arm
works", but doesn't name any. There may be a narrower path, for example a
cp_conn_w still in flight from a sendmsg just before the last close:

  rds_connect_worker()
    rds_loop_conn_path_connect()
      rds_connect_path_complete()

This re-queues cp_send_w and cp_recv_w after rds_conn_path_destroy() has
already cancelled them.

Could the commit message cite a trigger that can actually happen, such as
this one, as the reason for the Fixes tag? Or could it describe the patch
as hardening and a prerequisite for the following patches? Stable
backporters will rely on the reason given here.

[Severity: Low]
Is the IB device removal part of this comment accurate?

rds_ib_remove_one() calls rds_ib_dev_shutdown(), which does this for each
connection on rds_ibdev->conn_list:

net/rds/ib.c:rds_ib_dev_shutdown() {
    ...
	rds_conn_path_drop(&ic->conn->c_path[0], true);
    ...
}

With destroy == true, rds_conn_path_drop() skips the predicate and always
queues:

net/rds/connection.c:rds_conn_path_drop() {
    ...
	if (!destroy && rds_destroy_pending(cp->cp_conn)) {
	...
	}
	queue_work(cp->cp_wq, &cp->cp_down_w);
}

Neither rds_ib_dev_shutdown() nor rds_ib_remove_one() flushes cp_down_w
afterwards. The only flush_work(&cp->cp_down_w) is in
rds_conn_path_destroy().

Two other places have the same gap:

- The new comment above the WRITE_ONCE() in rds_conn_destroy() says the
  requeueing sites "all test rds_destroy_pending() under rcu_read_lock()".
- The commit message says the destroy itself "and IB device removal,
  issue and then flush".

The code looks safe today, but that comes from ordering. IB connections
are only destroyed by rds_ib_destroy_nodev_conns() from rds_ib_exit().
That runs after rds_ib_unregister_client() has finished every remove_one
callback. Any cp_down_w queued earlier is then flushed by
rds_conn_path_destroy().

Could the comments and commit message describe that ordering instead?
Later patches in the series build on this reasoning, and the rds.h comment
is unchanged at the end of the series.
