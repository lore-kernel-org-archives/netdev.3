Hi Jakub,

That's expected, not a regression, and it holds in both directions.
tc has copied min(RTA_PAYLOAD(xstats), sizeof(*st)) into a zeroed
struct since fq_pie support was first added to iproute2 (commit
9dced637, "tc: add support for FQ-PIE packet scheduler", 2019) - every
released tc that knows fq_pie parses this way, so an old tc against a
new kernel degrades to a zeroed row instead of erroring out. The
companion iproute2 patch carries the same discipline forward on the
new side too: fq_pie_print_xstats() treats a missing or zero type as
the qdisc case (`if (!st->type || st->type == TCA_FQ_PIE_XSTATS_QDISC)`),
so a new tc against an old, pre-type kernel also degrades gracefully
instead of misreading the blob. The companion iproute2 dependency is already
documented in patch 2/3's commit message and in both series' cover letters; 
we don't think it needs a third copy here.

Yes, intended - an unavoidable side effect of any qdisc gaining .cl_ops
for the first time. fq_codel, sfq and cake don't document the same
errno transitions either, so we don't think this needs it here.

fq_pie_class_ops has no .tcf_block. __tcf_qdisc_find()
(net/sched/cls_api.c) rejects any filter attach with -EOPNOTSUPP when
cops->tcf_block is NULL, before q->filter_list is touched. So
q->filter_list stays NULL for good, and fq_pie_classify()'s tcf branch
never runs.

That branch has no case for TC_ACT_CONSUMED - a gap shared with
fq_codel, sfq, cake, htb, hfsc, drr, qfq, multiq, prio, sfb, ets and
dualpi2, predating this series. It's unreachable here without
.tcf_block, which we're not adding, so it's out of scope.

We're not planning to fold this into the commit message - it's covered
above.

This is a gap and we don't dispute it, but it isn't new to fq_pie.
tc-fq-codel-xstats in tc.yaml is the flat qdisc_stats view - no
class-stats member, no enum for TCA_FQ_CODEL_XSTATS_QDISC/CLASS - even
though tc_fq_codel_xstats, the union struct cited above as the pattern
to follow, has had a class_stats arm since it was added. We believe this 
would be better handled in a logically separate patch series to bring tc.yaml
up to date with the current xstats structures across all qdiscs, rather than 
addressing fq_pie in isolation here.

Agreed this exists, and we've addressed the same point in a previous patch 
before: it's a display quirk. fq_codel has had the identical 16-bit 
TC_H_MIN() wraparound at the identical 65536-flow limit since 2012, 
and it isn't reachable through any other addressable operation - only 
a dump can ever surface it. We're staying consistent with fq_codel's 
long-standing, accepted behaviour rather than special-casing fq_pie alone 
for a display-only edge case for now. A separate patch can address 
both of these together.

Confirmed intentional - same convention as fq_codel_find(), sfq_find()
and cake_find(). Pseudo-classes across this whole family are dump-only
by design; nothing to change here.

Lockless READ_ONCE() stats dumps are already accepted, existing
practice in net/sched, and sch_pie carries the same u64 and
unclamped-prob exposure on the read side. Since this patch series is 
focused on class_stats, we’d prefer to make such annotations in a separate one.
