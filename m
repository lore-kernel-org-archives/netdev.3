Add dpll_features.sh, a script that exercises individual device and pin
callbacks with get/set roundtrips over netlink. It creates a dpllsim
device with the standard pin layout by default or runs against the
device named by DPLL_DEV_ID or the first device of the driver named by
DPLL_DRIVER, and picks the pin to reconfigure up front, so that no test
touches the reference the device is locked to. The pin is an input that
is disconnected or selectable on the device and that none of its parent
devices reports as connected or, where the tool prints the operational
state, as active, since a pin can be registered on several devices.
When the first input pin and another one both qualify the other one is
taken, drivers tend to list their primary reference first. On hardware
a spare pin with a valid signal can still be selected while a test
reconfigures it, which the header of the script points out.

The first test moves that pin through the states of the device mode,
as Documentation/driver-api/dpll.rst defines them, reads the state back
after each step and restores the original state at the end. In
automatic mode these are disconnected and selectable, and on the
device the script created the test then checks that connected is
refused. Hardware drivers are not held to that, ice accepts connected
in automatic mode, and a pin with the state-connected-override
capability would take over the reference. In manual mode connected and
disconnected
are the states, connecting the pin makes it the reference, so the test
finds the pin connected before, connects it back at the end and checks
that it is the reference again.

A driver may refuse a state the capability promises, for a constraint
the interface does not tell. That is a skip on a device provided by
the user, with the reason the tool reported, and a failure on the
device the script created, whose simulator accepts both states of its
mode. A refusal that follows a failed readback leaves the test failed,
dpll_log_test_skip_or_fail no longer turns a recorded failure into a
skip. The restores are deferred right after the original states are
read, the reconnect of the reference first, since deferred commands run
last in first out and the test pin has to be disconnected again before
the reference is connected back. The cleanup handler of every script
that defers runs the pending restores before it removes the devices the
script created, so that an interrupted run puts the device back as
well. defer drops the status of what it runs, so the restores go
through dpll_restore, which logs one that fails. A pin that cannot be
queried is a failure, not a pin that is in use or lacks a capability.

The stress script gains a test that floods one input pin of a fresh
device with changes between the states of automatic mode and ends on
selectable, the state a fresh pin is not in, so that the readback after
the flood catches a setter that stores nothing. The library
gains the state setter both use, which keeps the extack line of the
tool in DPLL_LAST_ERR so that a test can tell a refusal from a failure,
the device mode getter, and a check whether the pin set usage of the
tool knows a keyword, so that a test skips on a tool too old for it
rather than every script requiring a newer tool.

v4:
- defer the reconnect of the reference before the restore of the test
  pin, deferred commands run last in first out
- do not let a refusal turn a test that already failed into a skip
- pick the spare pin by all its parent devices and by the operational
  state where the tool prints it, and leave it alone when the automatic
  selection took it in the meantime
- accept connected when a pin was set selectable in automatic mode,
  the device may pick the pin it was offered as its reference, also
  when the restore makes it selectable again
- end the state flood on selectable, so that the readback catches a
  setter that stores nothing
- fail when the pin dump fails or the simulated device cannot be created
- say in the header what the tests change on a device the user provided
- log a deferred restore that fails, defer drops the status of what it
  runs
- tell a pin that could not be queried from one that is in use or
  lacks a capability, and log the reason of a refusal that follows a
  failure
- take the number of state changes of the flood from one variable
- add the Reviewed-by given to v3 (Ivan Vecera)

v3:
- follow the mode of the device under test: disconnected and
  selectable in automatic mode, where the simulator is checked to
  refuse connected, connected and disconnected in manual mode, where
  the pin connected before is connected back at the end
- cycle the state flooding test through the states of automatic mode
- add the device mode getter to the library
- honor DPLL_DRIVER like dpll_basic.sh does
- follow the move of the selftests to
  tools/testing/selftests/drivers/dpll
- the Reviewed-by and Acked-by of v2 are not carried over, the
  state test changed

v2:
- quote the ksft_skip expansion (netdev CI shellcheck)
