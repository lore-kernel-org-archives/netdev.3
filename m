socket errors are generally "consumed" when they are returned.
The user space should see one ENOBUF and then once the rcvbuf
is drained completely the CONGESTION bit should also get auto
cleared. This is my mental model how Netlink works, LMK if
you're seeing different behavior, my memory is faulty...
