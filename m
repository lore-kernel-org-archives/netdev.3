net/rds: include the scope id in the sendmsg connection cache check

The patch adds the interface index to the cached-connection test in
rds_sendmsg(), so that a send to a link-local peer through a different
interface no longer reuses the connection created for the first
interface.  Two questions below about the destination-less send case and
about the locking around the cache test.

[Severity: Medium]
Should the new comparison treat scope_id == 0 as "unspecified" rather
than as a mismatch?

For a send with msg_namelen == 0, rds_sendmsg() takes the scope from the
bound scope id:

net/rds/send.c:rds_sendmsg() {
	} else {
		/* We only care about consistency with ->connect() */
		lock_sock(sk);
		daddr = rs->rs_conn_addr;
		dport = rs->rs_conn_port;
		scope_id = rs->rs_bound_scope_id;
		release_sock(sk);
	}

and the namelen != 0 repair branch that would fill in a zero scope from
rs_bound_scope_id is skipped in that case.

rs_bound_scope_id can be 0 while rs_conn_addr is a link-local peer.
rds_connect() records the peer scope there for an unbound socket:

net/rds/af_rds.c:rds_connect() {
		if (addr_type & IPV6_ADDR_LINKLOCAL) {
			...
			rs->rs_bound_scope_id = sin6->sin6_scope_id;
		}
		rs->rs_conn_addr = sin6->sin6_addr;

and a later bind() to a non-link-local address overwrites it
unconditionally:

net/rds/bind.c:rds_add_bound() {
			*port = rs->rs_bound_port;
			rs->rs_bound_scope_id = scope_id;	/* 0 here */

With the sequence connect(fe80::x%ifA) -> bind(global address) ->
sendto(fe80::x%ifA) -> send() with no destination, the last send now
computes scope_id == 0, misses the cached ifA connection, and goes down
the else branch:

>  		conn = rs->rs_conn;
>  	} else {
>  		conn = rds_conn_create_outgoing(sock_net(sock->sk),
> 						&rs->rs_bound_addr, &daddr,
> 						rs->rs_transport, rs->rs_tos,
> 						sock->sk->sk_allocation,
> 						scope_id);

Since rds_conn_lookup() compares c_dev_if, this creates a new connection
with c_dev_if == 0 for a link-local destination.  Can that connection
ever come up?  rds_tcp_conn_path_connect() passes it on as the scope:

net/rds/tcp_connect.c:rds_tcp_conn_path_connect() {
		sin6.sin6_scope_id = conn->c_dev_if;

and tcp_v6_connect() rejects a link-local destination with no scope and
no sk_bound_dev_if:

net/ipv6/tcp_ipv6.c:tcp_v6_connect() {
		/* Connect to link-local address requires an interface */
		if (!sk->sk_bound_dev_if)
			return -EINVAL;

So the message looks like it gets queued on a connection that can never
be established, where before the patch it went out over ifA, and
rs->rs_conn is left pointing at the new connection.  Would skipping the
comparison when scope_id == 0, or keeping the connected peer's scope
separately from rs_bound_scope_id, avoid this?

[Severity: Medium]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but the cache test reads
rs->rs_conn several times without any synchronization, and the new
c_dev_if comparison is one more such read.

The validation loads and the load used for the assignment are separate:

net/rds/send.c:rds_sendmsg() {
	if (rs->rs_conn && ipv6_addr_equal(&rs->rs_conn->c_faddr, &daddr) &&
	    rs->rs_tos == rs->rs_conn->c_tos &&
	    rs->rs_conn->c_dev_if == scope_id) {
		conn = rs->rs_conn;

The socket lock covering the earlier scope-id checks has already been
dropped by the release_sock(sk) before rds_rdma_bytes(), and
rds_sock_lock, which the RDS_TOS ioctl path takes when it inspects
rs->rs_conn, is not held here either.  The publishing store in the else
branch is equally unsynchronized:

		rs->rs_conn = conn;

For two concurrent sendmsg() calls on the same AF_RDS socket (threads or
a shared fd), can one thread validate the connection for fe80::x%ifA and
then reload rs->rs_conn and pick up the fe80::x%ifB connection the other
thread just stored, so that rm->m_conn_path ends up on the unvalidated
connection?  That would be the same misrouting the changelog describes.

Would it be worth folding in a single snapshot of the pointer, for
example conn = READ_ONCE(rs->rs_conn); if (conn && ...), with a matching
WRITE_ONCE() on the store, or holding the socket lock across the cache
test?
