Hi Bryam,

Follow-up to the earlier KASAN + PROVE_LOCKING + DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP results.

I ran the same reproducer on the same z/VM guest with a KCSAN build of your
patch, interrupt watcher on. KCSAN found two af_iucv data races. Both
appeared during the sk_shutdown scenario. The second also appeared once in
rxclose scenario. I have the full KCSAN reports from /dev/kmsg now, so
the fields below are from them rather than from reading the code.

1) sk->sk_shutdown, 1 byte, same address on both sides.

A marked read in afiucv_hs_callback_rx(), inlined into afiucv_hs_dispatch():

     if (READ_ONCE(sk->sk_shutdown) & RCV_SHUTDOWN)

by interrupt on one CPU, against the plain read-modify-write in
iucv_sock_shutdown():

     sk->sk_shutdown |= how;

by task on the other CPU. The report gives the contexts as interrupt and 
task;
that the writer holds lock_sock() is from the source - iucv_sock_shutdown()
takes it on entry and that line is on every path to it.

The receive side must have come through the !afiucv_hs_defer() bypass rather
than the !sock_owned_by_user() arm. The writer holds lock_sock(), so
sk_lock.owned is set and slock is free; the reader runs inside 
bh_lock_sock(),
which is slock. For the two to overlap, the task must have finished
lock_sock() before the softirq took slock - so sock_owned_by_user() was 
true
when the softirq checked it. On the other arm the softirq holds slock while
nobody owns the socket, and a task entering lock_sock() blocks on slock 
until
the callback returns, so it cannot reach the write.

That is the window I asked you about in the previous comment, where a frame
can also be queued after shutdown(SHUT_RD)'s skb_queue_purge(), and which I
could not get to fire functionally. It has a KCSAN report behind it now.

Making the write a WRITE_ONCE() would silence KCSAN and fix nothing. The
frame-after-purge behaviour looks like an ordering problem.

2) iucv->hs_dev, 8 bytes, same address on both sides.

A plain read in afiucv_hs_rcv()'s socket-lookup loop:

     if (iucv_sk(sk)->hs_dev != dev)

by interrupt, with only read_lock(&iucv_sk_list.lock) held, against the 
plain
write in __iucv_sock_close():

     iucv->hs_dev = NULL;

by task, from an ordinary close() - the stack is iucv_sock_release ->
sock_close -> __fput -> sys_close, so the socket lock is held there.

The read is the ingress check added by Alexandra's 80230a18c164 and the
write was already there, so neither line is from your patches.
I do not think it needs locking: the lookup is inherently racy with close,
since the socket can be closed between the match and the dispatch however
well hs_dev is synchronised. I think both outcomes are harmless - observing
NULL early drops a frame that was about to be dropped anyway, and 
observing a
stale pointer gets the frame as far as the callbacks, which drop it on
sk_state. So I think the right treatment is READ_ONCE()/WRITE_ONCE() on the
two accesses with a comment saying the lookup read is deliberately
unsynchronised, rather than anything structural. Tell me if you see it
differently.

One more thing in the same function. __iucv_sock_close() does

     dev_put(iucv->hs_dev);
     iucv->hs_dev = NULL;

so between those two statements hs_dev names a device this socket no longer
holds a reference to, and the lookup loop can match on it. Clearing before
the put removes that window - via a local, since swapping the lines as they
stand would dev_put(NULL) and leak the reference:

     struct net_device *dev = iucv->hs_dev;

     if (dev) {
         iucv->hs_dev = NULL;
         sk->sk_bound_dev_if = 0;
         dev_put(dev);
     }

The test run also has 500+ KCSAN reports with skb_copy_bits / 
__might_fault.
All of them have
afiucv_hs_rcv() -> pskb_may_pull() -> __pskb_pull_tail() in the stack.
The conflict is on current->pagefault_disabled not skb data, so I don't 
think
either of your patches is involved.

Functionally the KCSAN kernel showed nothing new - the same rxclose and spin
failures as previous comment, everything else is clean.

Thanks,
Hidayath
