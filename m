net: mana: track when the HWC has been handed to the PF

The patch replaces the gc->max_num_cqs test in mana_hwc_destroy_channel()
with a new hw_channel_context::setup_active flag.  mana_smc_setup_hwc()
clears the flag on entry and sets it just before the ESTABLISH_HWC message
is written to shared memory, so teardown can tell whether the PF was ever
given the queue addresses.

[Severity: Medium]
The commit message says:

    No functional change is intended for the current single-establish flow.

Is that accurate for the failure paths?  gc->max_num_cqs is written in
exactly one place, mana_hwc_init_event_handler():

	case HWC_INIT_DATA_MAX_NUM_CQS:
		gd->gdma_context->max_num_cqs = val;

so it stays zero until the PF has processed ESTABLISH_HWC and started
delivering bootstrap EQEs.  hwc->setup_active is set in
mana_smc_setup_hwc() immediately before the writel() loop, so the new
condition is a strict superset of the old one.

Two paths reach mana_hwc_destroy_channel() with gc->max_num_cqs still 0 and
now send DESTROY_HWC where they previously sent nothing:

mana_hwc_establish_channel()
	if (!wait_for_completion_timeout(&hwc->hwc_init_eqe_comp, 60 * HZ))
		return -ETIMEDOUT;

mana_smc_setup_hwc()
	err = mana_smc_read_response(sc, SMC_MSG_TYPE_ESTABLISH_HWC,
				     SMC_MSG_TYPE_ESTABLISH_HWC_VERSION,
				     reset_vf);
	if (err) {
		dev_err(sc->dev, "Error when setting up HWC: %d\n", err);
		return err;
	}

On those paths mana_smc_teardown_hwc() polls mana_smc_poll_register() for up
to 20 * 1000 iterations of usleep_range(1000, 2000) and then polls again
inside mana_smc_read_response(), so a failing probe or resume against a
wedged PF can now take tens of seconds longer than before.

Should the changelog describe the error-path change and the extra polling
delay instead of stating no functional change?  Since the newly attempted
teardown is also what closes the existing window where the queue memory is
freed while the PF still holds its addresses on the establish-timeout path,
would a Fixes: tag be appropriate here?

[Severity: Low]
The comment explains that the flag is deliberately left set for a later
reader, but is there a reader left?  mana_hwc_destroy_channel() frees hwc a
few lines further down in the same function:

	kfree(hwc);
	gc->hwc.driver_data = NULL;

and mana_hwc_destroy_channel() is the only place that reads setup_active;
the only other references are the *submitted stores in mana_smc_setup_hwc()
and the &hwc->setup_active argument passed by
mana_hwc_establish_channel().  mana_hwc_create_channel() allocates a fresh
zeroed hw_channel_context, so a new attempt starts with setup_active ==
false regardless.

Does the else branch have any observable effect today, or is the retained
value discarded by the kfree(hwc) below?

[Severity: High]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but the new comment now states
the hazard explicitly while the code still proceeds: when
mana_smc_teardown_hwc() fails, "the device may still be using the queues",
yet the queue memory is freed unconditionally right here.

mana_hwc_destroy_wq() releases both the message buffer and the ring:

	mana_hwc_dealloc_dma_buf(hwc, hwc_wq->msg_buf);

	if (hwc_wq->gdma_wq)
		mana_gd_destroy_queue(hwc->gdma_dev->gdma_context,
				      hwc_wq->gdma_wq);

and both paths end in mana_gd_free_memory():

	dma_free_coherent(gmi->dev, PAGE_SIZE, gmi->pages_va[i],
			  gmi->pages_dma[i]);

mana_smc_teardown_hwc() documents why the response matters:

	/* Read shmem response (polling for VF possession) and validate.
	 * For teardown, waiting for response is required to ensure hardware
	 * invalidates MST entries before software frees memory.
	 */

A non-zero return therefore means the driver has no confirmation that the
MST entries were invalidated (mana_smc_poll_register() timed out, or the
response header did not confirm DESTROY_HWC).  Can the PF keep DMAing
completions and EQEs into pages that dma_free_coherent() has already
returned to the allocator in that case?  Would it be better to leak or
quarantine the HWC buffers when teardown is not confirmed rather than free
them?  The same log-only-and-continue sequence is still present at the tip
of the series (mana_hwc_destroy_channel() in c850f2d5).

[Severity: Low]
The clear here is unconditional and happens before the three pre-handover
exits (poll timeout, non-page-aligned addresses, msix index outside
VECTOR_MASK).  If a future caller ever enters mana_smc_setup_hwc() with a
handover still outstanding, would one of those exits silently downgrade the
flag to "device untouched" and make mana_hwc_destroy_channel() skip
DESTROY_HWC?  I checked that every mana_smc_setup_hwc() call in
mana_hwc_create_channel() at the series tip is preceded by a successful
mana_smc_teardown_hwc() plus hwc->setup_active = false, so this is not
reachable today, only a trap for the next caller.

[Severity: Low]
"Cleared again once that teardown succeeds" reads as state that survives an
attempt, but the field lives in the object that mana_hwc_destroy_channel()
kfree()s and that mana_hwc_create_channel() re-allocates zeroed.  Could the
comment say that the flag only lives for the lifetime of one
hw_channel_context?
