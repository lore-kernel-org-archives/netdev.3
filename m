Hi Bryam, Alexandra,

On a related note regarding accept_q: iucv_accept_poll() walks the 
parent's accept_q
with no lock at all, while iucv_accept_enqueue() appends from the IUCV 
tasklet and
the HiperSockets softirq under bh_lock_sock(parent). It doesn't show up 
in the sk_state
accounting because both accept_q walkers only read sk_state. I have a 
fix that takes
accept_q_lock for that walk and will send it to netdev as a standalone 
patch.

iucv_accept_dequeue() has the same problem, and I think it can also be 
fixed with
accept_q_lock rather than anything from the socket locking rework - 
though not by
simply wrapping the walk, since the loop body sleeps. It needs a 
preparatory patch
in iucv_callback_connreq() and afiucv_hs_callback_syn(), which are being 
touched by
the locking rework, so I'll hold both and rebase on your rework.

I also have a patch fixing sock/netdevice leaks on the connection 
request error
paths, in those same two functions. Just flagging it, since we will both 
be touching them.

Let me know how you'd like to sequence it.

Thanks,
Hidayath
