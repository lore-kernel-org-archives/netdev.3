From: Håkon Bugge <haakon.bugge@oracle.com>

rds_conn_shutdown() quiesces the transmit and receive-refill paths by
waiting for RDS_IN_XMIT and RDS_RECV_REFILL to be sampled clear, and
then runs the transport shutdown and rds_conn_path_reset().  Sampling
the bits clear is not the same as owning them: the moment after the
wait_event() returns, rds_send_xmit() can re-acquire RDS_IN_XMIT (or
rds_ib_recv_refill() can re-acquire RDS_RECV_REFILL) and run
concurrently with the teardown.

The sender does recheck the connection state after taking the lock,
but that recheck is a classic store-buffering pattern: teardown writes
the state and reads the bit while the sender writes the bit and reads
the state.  acquire_in_xmit() is only an acquire operation, so on
weakly ordered architectures both sides can miss each other's write,
and the transmit path then runs while the transport zeroes its rings
(e.g. rds_ib_ring_init()) and rds_send_path_reset() rewrites the
transmit state under it.

Oracle UEK fixed the same class of crashes - a 14-year tail of
BUG_ON()s in rds_ib_sub_signaled(), unexpected op-codes and NULL
dereferences in rds_ib_send_cqe_handler() during failover testing -
by making the teardown path *acquire* the fastpath bit locks instead
of testing them ("rds: Make sure transmit path and connection
tear-down does not run concurrently").  Ownership of a single word is
decided by RMW atomicity, so no cross-variable ordering is needed.

Do the same here: take both locks before calling the transport
shutdown, hold them across rds_conn_path_reset(), and release them
explicitly with a wake-up afterwards.  Both are released with
clear_bit_unlock(), so that the ring re-initialization done by the
transport shutdown and the transmit state rewritten by
rds_send_path_reset() are ordered before either bit is seen clear by
the next acquire_in_xmit() or acquire_refill().

The fastpath users of these bits - rds_send_xmit() and
rds_ib_recv_refill() - are trylock style and back off while teardown
owns the locks, so no new lock dependency is introduced for them.
rds_tcp_reset_callbacks() is different: since the previous patch it
acquires RDS_IN_XMIT as well, and it blocks doing so, so its wait now
spans the teardown instead of at most one send batch.  That waiter
runs from rds_tcp_accept_one() on the single-threaded krdsd workqueue
and holds rds_tcp_accept_lock and t_conn_path_lock while it waits, so
a duelling SYN accepted while its path is being torn down parks
accept processing for the duration of the teardown - for TCP bounded
by the (up to 5 s) drain loop in rds_tcp_conn_path_shutdown().  The
window is narrow: the accept-side state check has to pass before the
teardown moves the path to RDS_CONN_DISCONNECTING.

Because krdsd is a single global workqueue, everything else queued
there - accept processing for other connections and network
namespaces, and the flush_workqueue(rds_wq) in rds_tcp_listen_stop()
during namespace teardown - waits behind the parked accept worker for
that time.  It cannot deadlock: the teardown runs on the path's own
ordered workqueue and never waits on krdsd, so it always completes
the drain and releases the bit (on the allocation-failure fallback
where a path shares rds_wq, the two work items simply serialize).
Nor is the blocking wait itself new: rds_tcp_reset_callbacks() has
waited on RDS_IN_XMIT from the krdsd work item since
commit 335b48d980f6 ("RDS: TCP: Add/use rds_tcp_reset_callbacks to
reset tcp socket safely"); this patch stretches its worst case from
a sender's batch to the teardown's drain.  The alternative to parking
is the accept path racing the teardown, which is what these patches
close; making the teardown itself non-blocking is a separate item.

One observable side effect: the SENDING flag reported by rds-info has
always mirrored RDS_IN_XMIT, so it now also covers the window where
teardown owns the bit.

The comments that describe the old sample-based handshake or name
rds_send_xmit() as the only other holder of these bits - in
rds_send_xmit(), above rds_conn_path_reset(), in rds_ib_recv_refill()
and in rds_tcp_reset_callbacks() - are updated to match.

For anyone backporting this patch standalone: it depends on
"net/rds: clear cp_flags bits individually in rds_conn_path_reset()"
and "net/rds: acquire RDS_IN_XMIT in rds_tcp_reset_callbacks()"
earlier in this series.  Without the former, the blanket cp_flags
clear in rds_conn_path_reset() would drop both held bits in the middle
of the teardown; without the latter, rds_tcp_reset_callbacks() would
still sample t_sock without owning RDS_IN_XMIT.
