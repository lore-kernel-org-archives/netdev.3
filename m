Subject: [PATCH net-next v6 10/12] net/rds: pin the connection across RDMA-CM event handling

rds_rdma_cm_event_handler_cmn() picks the connection up from
cm_id->context, which carries no reference, and holds c_cm_lock - a
mutex that lives in the connection's path array - across the transport
callbacks.  Before this series that was already a use-after-free
whenever a callback destroyed the connection, since rds_conn_destroy()
freed it synchronously and the handler's mutex_unlock() ran on freed
memory; the one such callback, rds_ib_cm_connect_complete() on a
protocol version below 3.1, has meanwhile been switched to
rds_conn_drop() by commit f97d8c7bab78 ("rds: ib: use rds_conn_drop()
on protocol version mismatch"), which also removed the deadlock that
destroy took on c_cm_lock.

Now that a connection is freed by its last reference, the remaining
exposure is a callback that drops the last reference other than the
handler's - which has none - and the reference handed out by
rds_conn_create() to rds_ib_cm_handle_connect() and dropped at its
end.  Take a reference for the duration of the handler, and ignore the
event if the connection is already being freed: its cm_id teardown is
what stops event delivery, so an event that still arrives belongs to a
connection whose shutdown has run and whose memory is on its way out.

rds_ib_cm_handle_connect() has the mirror-image hole: a connection
whose destroy has already quiesced it sits in RDS_CONN_DOWN with no
cm_id, which is exactly the state the DOWN -> CONNECTING transition
claims.  A connect request arriving then would install a new cm_id and
QP on a connection that is only waiting for its last reference to go
away, and nothing would tear them down again.  Re-check
rds_destroy_pending() under c_cm_lock and reject the request instead.
