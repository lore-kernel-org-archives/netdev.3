Hi,

Nine fixes for serious bugs in the ibmveth driver: two hang the
system, four are use-after-frees, one corrupts memory, one lets a
frame from another partition stall or oops the receiver, and one makes
ethtool -L report success when it failed.

  1. Netpoll races with RX replenish (memory corruption, NULL
     dereference): remove ndo_poll_controller, as was done for
     ibmvnic, skip RX replenish in netpoll's budget-0 poll, and
     enable NAPI only once the RX resources exist.
     Fixes: 6b4223748895, bea3348eef27

  2. Hang after a failed internal reopen: the next close() waits in
     napi_disable() forever with RTNL held, and only a reboot
     recovers. Skip close() when open() did not succeed.
     Fixes: 860f242eb534

  3. Use-after-free in remove(): a reset queued from NAPI could run
     on the freed adapter. Disable the reset work first.
     Fixes: 2c91e2319ed9

  4. Hang or NULL dereference on a bad RX correlator from PHYP: poll
     spun on that slot until RCU stalled, and a correlator naming an
     inactive pool dereferenced NULL. A frame that does not fit its
     buffer was copied past the end. Move past the bad slot and stay
     in poll, and drop a frame that does not fit.
     Fixes: 2c91e2319ed9, 860f242eb534

  5. Use-after-free after a failed probe: the pool kobjects stay in
     sysfs after the adapter is freed. Put them, as remove() does,
     and give them a release() that probe and remove() wait for, so
     CONFIG_DEBUG_KOBJECT_RELEASE cannot free them early either.
     Fixes: 860f242eb534

  6. ethtool -L returns 0 when it cannot allocate the new TX queues.
     Return the allocation error.
     Fixes: 10c2aba89cc0

  7. Use-after-free of TX buffers: close() frees them without
     waiting for a running transmit. It is called directly for MTU,
     offload and buffer pool changes, and through dev_close(), which
     does not wait either with a noqueue qdisc. Use
     netif_tx_disable().
     Fixes: d6832ca48d8a

  8. Use-after-free of the RX queue: napi_disable() returns before
     the poll has finished, and the rest of the poll re-enables the
     interrupt and reads the RX queue that close() then frees. Wait
     with synchronize_net().
     Fixes: bea3348eef27

  9. Stall or oops from a frame sent by another partition: the RX
     checksum helper passes the IPv4 ihl to ip_fast_csum(), which on
     ppc64 reads up to 16 GiB for ihl 0, and both RX offload helpers
     trust the IP and TCP header lengths. Check the headers before
     use, with KUnit cases.
     Fixes: 9c7e8bc584f5, 7b5967389f5a, 66aa0678efc2

Patches 1-8 were found in review of the ibmveth multi-queue RX
series [1] (the patch 4 frame bound by the Sashiko review of v2), and
patch 9 by the Sashiko review of v3 and the review that followed it.
Landing them first also shrinks that series, which then only extends
this handling per queue.

Testing: the new and extended KUnit cases in patches 4 and 9 fail or
oops on the unfixed driver and pass on qemu pseries (ppc64le). On a
POWER10 LPAR: the v3 suite (netconsole under printk and ping floods,
MTU and buffer pool changes under traffic, a forced open() failure
followed by down and up, unbind/bind under traffic, a forced
register_netdev() failure in probe, ethtool -L with a forced TX
buffer allocation failure, and rapid link down/up and MTU cycles under
a ping flood for patch 8) and patch 9 large-send regression on v5
(iperf3 over IPv4 and IPv6 at MTU 1500 and 9000, threaded NAPI and
busy polling; no new drops or InCsumErrors). The forced failures used
test-only module parameters that are not part of this series.

The triggers are rare and there are no field reports, so the series
targets net-next. It is based on net-next d8674294aefe ("Merge
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/netdev/net"), which
includes the two open() error-path fixes (af0524bf4ce1,
84bec0bf0352). Patch 2 explains how it relates to them. It also
applies cleanly to net. All carry Fixes: tags; I am happy to
repost against net, or add Cc: stable, if you prefer.

Changes in v5:

Patches 1-8: commit message wording only; the code is unchanged.

Patch 9 fixes a gso_segs undercount found by the Sashiko review of v4.
The large send helper accepted a frame longer than its IP length and
computed gso_segs from the IP length. Bytes past the IP length stay in
a bridged or switched frame, so the egress path produced more segments
than gso_segs claimed. The helper now refuses a frame whose IP length
is not the frame length.

Also in patch 9: new KUnit cases for that and for header-only frames,
so the TCP payload check is still covered. The message no longer says
a refused frame is checked by the stack, which a bridged or switched
frame is not.

v4: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20261012050518.88858-1-mmc@linux.ibm.com/

Changes in v4:

Patches 1-3 and 5-8 are unchanged.

Patch 4: the poll tail queues the NAPI instead of polling again, so
it cannot race a threaded NAPI under busy polling, and harvest uses
the correlator poll already read (Sashiko review of v3). The message
no longer claims the frame bound protects the offload helpers.

New patch 9: the RX offload helpers' header checks that the review of
v3 patch 4 asked for, as their own patch with their own Fixes: tags
and KUnit cases.

v3: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20261009183258.18624-1-mmc@linux.ibm.com/

Changes in v3:

From the Sashiko review of v2:
- Patch 4: on a bad RX slot, stay in the poll loop and return
  budget - 1 after napi_schedule() has queued the napi. Breaking
  out was queuing it twice.
- Patch 4: drop a frame that does not fit its buffer, instead of
  copying past the end.
- Patch 4: also drop a frame shorter than an Ethernet header, and
  take the pool for the buffer bound from the correlator that was
  validated, read once.
- Patch 2: commit message: the two open() fixes are now in net-next.

v2: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/cover.1791178212.git.mmc@linux.ibm.com/

Changes in v2:

From the Sashiko review of v1:
- Patch 5: give the pool kobjects a release() and wait for it before
  free_netdev() in probe and remove(), which closes the
  CONFIG_DEBUG_KOBJECT_RELEASE window.
- New patch 8: wait for the poll to return before close() frees the
  RX queue (raised on patch 1 as a pre-existing bug).

Other small changes:
- Patch 1: also skip RX replenish in netpoll's budget-0 poll.
- Patch 4: count rx_dropped when recycling an invalid buffer fails.
- Commit messages: say how each bug was found and tested, with small
  clarifications in patches 2 and 7.

Rebased on current net-next.
