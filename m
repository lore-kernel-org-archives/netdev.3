net/rds: free every path's transport data on the passive create paths

This moves the per-path transport-data free loop of __rds_conn_create()
into a new helper, rds_conn_free_transport_data(), and calls it from the
passive-conn exit as well as from the lost-creation-race exit.  The
changelog describes the passive exit as leaking transport data for paths
1..npaths-1 of a multipath connection.

[Severity: Medium]
Can this exit ever run with npaths > 1?

The changelog says:

    RDS/TCP loopback is exactly a multipath passive connection, so this
    is reachable.

npaths comes from the caller's transport at the top of
__rds_conn_create():

	int npaths = (trans->t_mp_capable ? RDS_MPATH_WORKERS : 1);

and t_mp_capable is set only by rds_tcp_transport in net/rds/tcp.c.

parent is only set when the initial rds_conn_lookup() finds a conn
matching:

	if (conn &&
	    conn->c_loopback &&
	    conn->c_trans != &rds_loop_transport &&
	    ipv6_addr_equal(laddr, faddr) &&
	    !is_outgoing) {

and rds_conn_lookup() also requires conn->c_trans == trans, so the found
conn's transport is the caller's transport.

c_loopback is set in only one place, and for TCP (t_prefer_loopback == 1)
that same block either rewrites the transport or fails the request:

		conn->c_loopback = 1;
		if (trans->t_prefer_loopback) {
			if (likely(is_outgoing)) {
				trans = &rds_loop_transport;
			} else {
				...
				conn = ERR_PTR(-EOPNOTSUPP);
				goto out;
			}
		}

Since conn->c_trans = trans is assigned afterwards, a hashed conn with
c_loopback == 1 and c_trans == &rds_tcp_transport does not seem to exist,
which is also why the in-tree comment on that lookup says "This is a
looped back IB connection".  rds_tcp_accept_one() additionally rejects a
local peer address with -EOPNOTSUPP before reaching rds_conn_create().

If that is right, the only transport reaching this branch is IB, which
has t_mp_capable == 0, so npaths == 1 and the previous single
trans->conn_free(conn->c_path[0].cp_transport_data) already freed
everything.  Would it be more accurate to describe this as an equivalent
refactor / hardening change rather than a leak fix, and to drop the
Fixes: 1c5113cf796b tag so it is not picked up for stable as a leak fix?

[Severity: High]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but while looking at how
npaths is used on these rollback paths: does the create/destroy npaths
disagreement leak the per-path ordered workqueues for loopback-substituted
RDS/TCP connections?

__rds_conn_create() computes npaths from the caller's transport (8 for
TCP), then substitutes the loop transport for an outgoing connection to a
local address:

			trans = &rds_loop_transport;
	...
	conn->c_trans = trans;

npaths is not recomputed, so the init loop still allocates a workqueue for
all 8 paths:

	for (i = 0; i < npaths; i++) {
		...
		conn->c_path[i].cp_wq =
			alloc_ordered_workqueue("krds_cp_wq#%lu/%d", 0,
						rds_conn_count, i);

rds_loop_conn_alloc() only sets conn->c_transport_data, which
rds_single_path.h maps to c_path[0].cp_transport_data, so paths 1..7 keep
cp_transport_data == NULL.

rds_conn_destroy() then recomputes npaths from conn->c_trans, which is now
the loop transport:

	int npaths = (conn->c_trans->t_mp_capable ? RDS_MPATH_WORKERS : 1);

so only path 0 is torn down, and rds_conn_path_destroy() would skip the
rest anyway:

	if (!cp->cp_transport_data)
		return;

before it reaches destroy_workqueue(cp->cp_wq).  kfree(conn->c_path) then
drops the last pointers to the 7 remaining workqueues.

The reachable sequence looks like: an AF_RDS socket using the TCP
transport sends to a local address, rds_conn_create_outgoing() ->
__rds_conn_create() builds the loop-substituted conn with 8 workqueues,
and netns exit (rds_loop_exit_net -> rds_loop_kill_conns ->
rds_conn_destroy) or module unload leaves 7 unbound ordered workqueues per
such conn.  Distinct 127.0.0.0/8 destinations create more conns, so this
repeats.

The same shape appears at the end of the series in rds_conn_destroy_fini(),
which derives npaths from conn->c_trans, while rds_conn_path_free() still
early-returns on !cp_transport_data before destroy_workqueue().

Would it make sense to store the allocated path count on the connection
(or recompute npaths after the loop-transport substitution) so create and
destroy always agree, and to destroy cp_wq independently of
cp_transport_data?
