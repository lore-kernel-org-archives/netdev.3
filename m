Fine with me. The S32G accessor is a few lines, so I will move it onto
pcs-xpcs-regmap if that lands first, or onto a shared mmio helper if
you post one. Until then it stays open-coded in the glue.

Agreed on the principle. The problem is that pcs_pre_config and the
PMA hook are reached only through the ID-keyed compat table, and S32G
needs a pma_config (link timer, lane on MPLLA). Without a platform
callback the ID is the only way in.

What I have for v4 is an ID-keyed entry with the two quirks as
explicit flags in struct dw_xpcs_desc (no soft reset, no EEE), so at
least the table says what the entry does.

Same DW XPCS IP, different integration. SJA1105/1110 are switches with
the XPCS behind their internal MDIO; S32G is an SoC with the XPCS in an
MMIO window inside the SerDes, sharing the PMA with a PCIe lane. The
PMA sequences differ, and so do the quirks. The ID is synthetic in all
three cases. On S32G the XPCS reports the generic DW ID 0x7996ced0
and the PMA/PCS/AN MMDs read as zero (checked on an RDB3), so there is
no hardware ID to key S32G behaviour on.

Yes, please Cc me on the callback thread.
