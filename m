net: skbuff: don't leave stale bytes in skb_copy_and_csum_bits()

This patch zeroes the rest of the destination buffer in
skb_copy_and_csum_bits() when the function reaches unreadable frags.
Before, those bytes were left as they were. The commit message says
this affects ICMP error quoting and driver TX bounce buffers. It also
says the returned checksum is already wrong, so the receiver drops the
packet anyway.

[Severity: Low]
Can the skb_copy_and_csum_dev() path see unreadable frags at all?

These drivers call skb_copy_and_csum_dev():

  ep93xx_eth, ec_bhf, ksz884x, 8139too, sc92031, via-rhine

The sunvnet TX path does too. None of them sets dev->netmem_tx, so they
are all NETMEM_TX_NONE.

validate_xmit_skb() calls validate_xmit_unreadable_skb() first, and
that frees these skbs before ndo_start_xmit is reached:

net/core/dev.c:validate_xmit_unreadable_skb() {
    ...
	if (dev->netmem_tx == NETMEM_TX_NONE)
		goto out_free;
    ...
}

Only bnxt, gve, mlx5, fbnic and netkit set netmem_tx. None of them
calls skb_copy_and_csum_dev().

The ICMP/ICMPv6 quote path through icmp_glue_bits() still justifies the
fix. Could the driver bounce buffer example be dropped from the commit
message? This is a Fixes-tagged patch, and the example could mislead
stable backporters.

[Severity: High]
The commit message says "The checksum is already wrong in this case, so
the packet still gets dropped by the receiver". Does that hold when
offset >= skb_headlen(skb), so nothing is copied from the linear area?

In that case the whole range is zeroed and 0 is returned. 0 is the
correct partial checksum for an all-zero buffer, so the data and the
checksum now agree.

In the !sg && !csum arm, skb_segment() stores this return value without
checking skb_frags_readable():

net/core/skbuff.c:skb_segment() {
    ...
				SKB_GSO_CB(nskb)->csum =
					skb_copy_and_csum_bits(head_skb, offset,
							       skb_put(nskb,
								       len),
							       len);
    ...
}

tcp_gso_segment() then folds it into the TCP checksum:

	th->check = gso_make_checksum(skb, ~th->check);

The result is a TCP checksum that is valid over a payload of zeros.

For a devmem TCP TX skb, the linear area holds only the headers and all
payload sits in net_iov frags. So every segment has offset >= headlen.

This path looks reachable after something like "ethtool -K dev sg off
tx off" on a NETMEM_TX_DMA device (bnxt, gve, mlx5, fbnic).
validate_xmit_unreadable_skb() lets the skb through, because netmem_tx
is DMA and the binding dev matches. Turning SG off also drops TSO, so
netif_needs_gso() is true and the skb takes this path:

validate_xmit_skb()->skb_gso_segment()->...->tcp_gso_segment()->
    skb_segment()->skb_copy_and_csum_bits()

skb_segment() runs with sg and csum both false.

skb_orphan_frags() returns 0 here because msg_zerocopy_alloc() sets
SKBFL_DONT_ORPHAN.

tcp_sendmsg_locked() checks NETIF_F_SG only at send time. Skbs already
in the write or retransmit queues are affected either way.

Would the peer then accept and ACK these zeroed segments as real stream
data? Before this patch the stale bytes did not match the returned 0,
so the segment was dropped.

Would it be better to return a checksum that is deliberately wrong
here? Another option is for skb_segment() to reject unreadable skbs, as
the csum arm already does when skb_copy_bits() returns -EFAULT.
