Yes, but the the alternative to waiting is an unclean unload.  Without the
wait, the same sequence described above unloads rds_tcp with the inc still
queued.  Then the next rds_inc_put() calls conn->c_trans->inc_free, and for
an IB inc dereferences the freed connection which turns into a uaf.  So
waiting avoids the uaf and as well as a working unload.

Also the wait cannot be made interruptible/abortable in any way useful.
By the time rds_tcp_exit() runs, delete_module() has moved the module to
MODULE_STATE_GOING and the exit function has no way to fail. An early retur=
n
on a signal would unload over the live references, which is a UAF again.
If we purged the incs from the socket receive queues, it silently discards
datagrams that have been acknowledged to the peer from sockets nobody close=
d.=C2=A0
Not discarding queued data is the one rule the teardown in this series foll=
ows
throughout, so I would rather keep it than add a drop path for a case that
today crashes.

Finally who controls the wait is not new.  The app owning the socket ends i=
t by
reading or closing, or being killed by an admin. An unprivileged socket can
already keep the transport loaded for as long as it wants, and an rmmod sim=
ply
returns -EBUSY until the socket closes. The cross-transport case differs on=
ly in
that an inc holds no module reference, so the same hold shows up as a wait =
rather
than an immediate -EBUSY.

In any case, this complaint has come up a few times in prior reviews, and w=
e've
added commentary around it as well as a warning that prints every 10 second=
s.
I will send a v12 for the other sashiko reviews on patches 4 and 11, but I =
wanted
to explain why this review wouldnt be in it.

Thanks for the reviews!
Allison
