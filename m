ibmveth: Complete set_channels down-path and mq_fallback max_rx cap

This completes the ethtool -L path in ibmveth: the down-path publishes the
desired RX count without allocating, the up-path resizes RX then TX and
rolls RX back if TX cannot reach the requested count, and get_channels()
now caps max_rx at the live rx_count once mq_fallback is set.
ibmveth_poll_controller() also returns early when the adapter is closed.

[Severity: Medium]
Once mq_fallback is set, does the advertised max_rx still match what the
driver will accept?

Here max_rx becomes the live rx_count, which can be 8 or 16.  The core only
bounds the request by that value, in ethtool_set_channels():

    if (channels.rx_count > curr.max_rx ||
        channels.tx_count > curr.max_tx ||

So every value in 1..rx_count reaches the driver.  But
ibmveth_resize_rx_channels() refuses any changed count above 1 in that
state, after the no-op shortcut:

    if (goal_rx == old_rx)
            return 0;
    ...
    if (goal_rx > 1 && (!adapter->multi_queue || adapter->mq_fallback)) {
            netdev_err(netdev,
                       "Cannot resize to %u RX queues: multi-queue mode not supported by firmware\n",
                       goal_rx);
            return -EOPNOTSUPP;
    }

With mq_fallback set and a live count of 8, ethtool -l reports max_rx 8 while
ethtool -L ethX rx 2 through rx 7 all fail with -EOPNOTSUPP; only 1 and the
current count are accepted.

This state looks persistent rather than transient, since
ibmveth_register_rx_queues() latches the flag and then fails the open:

    if (rc) {
            /* Firmware MQ gone: fall back to SQ on next open. */
            if (rc == -EOPNOTSUPP)
                    adapter->mq_fallback = true;
            goto err_unregister;
    }

adapter->opened stays false and num_rx_queues keeps its old value above 1
until the next successful open.

Would it be clearer to advertise max_rx = 1 in the fallback state and keep
the no-op shortcut for the read-modify-write case?  The kernel-doc for
ibmveth_resize_rx_channels() ("Rejects rx > 1 without MQ firmware
(-EOPNOTSUPP)") also does not mention that the no-op shortcut precedes the
gate.

[Severity: Low]
Is the read of adapter->mq_fallback here synchronized against its writer?

The flag is stored from softirq/NAPI context in ibmveth_replenish_task(),
after the replenish_lock has already been dropped:

    spin_unlock_irqrestore(&rxq->replenish_lock, flags);
    ...
            adapter->mq_fallback = true;
            schedule_work(&adapter->work);

The new reader added here, and the capability gate in
ibmveth_resize_rx_channels():

    if (goal_rx > 1 && (!adapter->multi_queue || adapter->mq_fallback)) {

run under RTNL / the netdev ops lock, which does not exclude the softirq
writer.  There is no lock, no READ_ONCE()/WRITE_ONCE() and no acquire/release
pairing on this field, while the sibling field num_rx_queues in the same
struct is deliberately published with:

    smp_store_release(&adapter->num_rx_queues, num);

A stale false read here would advertise max_rx = IBMVETH_MAX_RX_QUEUES right
after firmware refused MQ buffer adds, and a stale read in the gate would let
the driver allocate and replenish RX queues on that firmware, re-latching
mq_fallback and queueing another reset.  Would WRITE_ONCE()/READ_ONCE() on
mq_fallback, or folding it into the existing publish/consume helpers, be
appropriate?

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but does this comment still describe the code below it?

It says num_slots is read "at function entry" and "can return a stale
geometry from before the resize", yet the read it annotates happens right
here, inside the if (rx_changed) block, after ibmveth_resize_rx_channels()
has already changed the RX geometry.  Function entry only reads
num_rx_queues, real_num_tx_queues, channels->rx_count and channels->tx_count.

The comment looks like a leftover from the v5 layout mentioned in the
changelog, and now warns about a hazard that would only exist if the read
were moved back to function entry.

[Severity: Low]
Can this rollback re-attempt a queue geometry that the forward path would
have refused?

The rollback calls ibmveth_resize_rx_queues_incremental() directly, so the
multi_queue / mq_fallback gate in ibmveth_resize_rx_channels() is not
consulted.  That gate only rejects goal_rx > 1:

    if (goal_rx > 1 && (!adapter->multi_queue || adapter->mq_fallback)) {
            ...
            return -EOPNOTSUPP;
    }

Consider adapter->opened true, mq_fallback already latched from softirq in
ibmveth_replenish_task():

    adapter->mq_fallback = true;
    schedule_work(&adapter->work);

and a live RX count of 8.  A request of rx 1 with a larger tx passes the gate
(goal_rx is 1), RX shrinks 8 -> 1 and rx_changed becomes true.  If the TX
step then fails in ibmveth_allocate_tx_ltb() or
netif_set_real_num_tx_queues(), the rollback runs the scale-up path back to
old_rx = 8 on firmware that has already refused MQ buffer adds, so
H_REG_LOGICAL_LAN_QUEUE / replenish hit the same H_FUNCTION, mq_fallback is
re-latched and another schedule_work(&adapter->work) reset is queued from an
ethtool error path.

Would it be better to route the rollback through
ibmveth_resize_rx_channels(), or to skip it when mq_fallback is set and leave
RX at 1?
