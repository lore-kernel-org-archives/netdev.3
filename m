I am quite worried by the complexity this series adds to six dequeue paths,
for a problem that needs a pretty unusual size table to show up.

I do not think the round tracking (first/scanned) is needed.

As long as no flow can be served, a round gives one quantum to every flow
and leaves the list in the same order. So the number of rounds needed
before the first flow can be served can be computed from the current head,
at any time, and added to all flows in one pass. There is no need to know
where the round started, nor to fix up 'first' in the throttle, drop and
detach paths.

Empty flows do not need to be removed in the bulk pass either: give them
the credit they would have had when detached, and let the normal path
detach them on their next visit. For fq_codel, this also keeps the reset
of the CoDel vars done by codel_dequeue(), which was one of the v2 issues.

To bound the cost of the scans, a dequeue-local refill counter is enough:
scan after a few refills, then allow the next scan only after as many
refills as flows scanned. The scan stops at the first flow with credit,
so normal setups only look at a couple of flows.

Something like the following for fq. It adds a helper and a few lines
where the head flow is refilled, and does not touch the other paths.
All flows share the same quantum, so the scan needs a single divide,
plus one per empty flow about to be detached.

With a setup close to yours (8192 flows, stab overhead 1MB, quantum 256,
fq under tbf), the longest fq_dequeue() goes from 8.4 ms to 19 us, and
the total time spent in fq_dequeue() during the drain goes from 138 ms
to 3.4 ms. The dequeue order captured with tcpdump on four mixed loads
is the same before and after.

The same helper shape should work for fq_codel, fq_pie, drr and sfq.
For DRR, a class whose child returns NULL from peek() can simply abort
the scan, as the main loop already handles that case.

ETS has at most 16 bands, I would leave it alone.

Also please, one patch per qdisc.
