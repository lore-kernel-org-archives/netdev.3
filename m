No objections from my side to take the process lifecycle fix, I would however
suggest that this goes into net-next tree in this case: the BPF CI does not
depend on this script, and if we would merge it into bpf-next then you'd have
to wait for ~8 weeks before the trees sync during the merge window.. that way
via net-next you can continue with the migration and as next step cleanly/
conflict-free remove the test_xdp_features.sh script from BPF selftests and
adding it for net/driver HW selftests.
