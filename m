tls: Consume empty data records in tls_sw_recvmsg()

This patch adds a branch to tls_sw_recvmsg() that consumes zero-length
application_data records as soon as they are decrypted. Before this, the
peek and async arms queued every empty record on rx_list. The new branch
sets MSG_EOR itself and continues the receive loop.

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but at this commit the only zero-length record selftest
is TEST_F(zero_len, test) in tools/testing/selftests/net/tls.c. It receives
on a zc-capable TLS 1.2 socket with a user buffer and without MSG_PEEK:

	EXPECT_EQ(__tls_recv_cmsg(_metadata, self->cfd, NULL,
				  buf, sizeof(buf), MSG_DONTWAIT), ret);

So every empty record takes the darg.zc arm, and this consume_skb() call
never runs in that test.

A later patch in the series, "selftests: tls: Add peek and splice coverage
for zero-length records", adds TEST_F(zero_len_peek, test). That test uses
MSG_DONTWAIT | MSG_PEEK, which covers this non-zc path. The async arm is
still not covered, because that needs an async crypto driver.

[Severity: Medium]
This is a pre-existing issue, but can tls_sw_recvmsg() return 0 on a live
connection? This would happen when an empty application_data record is
followed directly by a non-data record, such as an alert or a TLS 1.3
NewSessionTicket or KeyUpdate.

For the empty record, tls_record_content_type() sets control to
TLS_RECORD_TYPE_DATA and emits the TLS_GET_RECORD_TYPE cmsg. This branch
then consumes the record and continues.

For the next record, tls_record_content_type() finds a type mismatch:

	} else if (*control != tlm->control) {
		return 0;
	}

The err <= 0 arm in tls_sw_recvmsg() then queues that skb on rx_list and
jumps to recv_end with err == 0. Since copied == 0, this returns 0:

	return copied ? : err;

An application that does not check the cmsg would read that as EOF. One
example is OpenSSL's ktls_read_record path.

The zc and sync non-zc arms already behaved this way before this patch.
The zero_len 0data_0data_ctrl variant in tools/testing/selftests/net/tls.c
also expects this result:

	.recs = { &id0_data_l0, &id1_data_l0, &id2_ctrl_l11, },
	.recv_ret = { 0, 11, -EAGAIN, },

Is a 0 return with a DATA cmsg the intended behaviour here?

[Severity: Medium]
This is a pre-existing issue, but this branch always continues. An empty
record changes neither bound in the loop condition:

	while (len && (decrypted + copied < target || tls_strp_msg_ready(ctx))) {

So with the socket lock held, a reader keeps consuming empty records for
as long as the peer streams them. Only the nodata && signal_pending()
check at the top of the loop ends the run.

Take a MSG_DONTWAIT reader that has copied nothing. tls_rx_rec_wait()
returns -EAGAIN only when no record is ready, so that reader can stay in
the kernel while the peer keeps records coming. Other users of the socket
wait in lock_sock() during that time. tls_read_flush_backlog() can reach
__release_sock() and cond_resched(), so this is a stall rather than a
lockup.

The commit message mentions this: "still reads empty records for as long
as they arrive, until a signal is pending". The sibling reader,
tls_sw_read_sock(), caps a run of empty records:

	if (++nodata >= TLS_RX_NODATA_LIMIT) {
		schedule_work(&ctx->data_ready_work);
		break;
	}

Would a similar cap make sense in tls_sw_recvmsg()?

At this commit the branch also keeps going after the rcvlowat target has
been met. Data already copied is then held back while empty records keep
arriving. The next patch in the series, "tls: Return copied data ahead of
a run of empty records", adds a "decrypted + copied >= target" break to
this branch, which fixes that part.
