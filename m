net/rds: make rds_destroy_pending() cover single-connection destroy

This adds a per-connection conn->c_destroy_in_prog flag, set by
rds_conn_destroy() before the unhash plus synchronize_rcu() sequence, and
tests it from rds_destroy_pending() so that the work-requeueing sites stop
arming path works on a connection that is being torn down.  The now unused
RDS_DESTROY_PENDING cp_flags bit and its dead test in
rds_ib_is_unloading() are removed.

A few questions on the new comments and on the per-connection destroy path
this is aimed at.

[Severity: Low]

This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but the contract comment
immediately above rds_conn_destroy() still reads:

  /*
   * Stop and free a connection.
   *
   * This can only be used in very limited circumstances.  It assumes that once
   * the conn has been shutdown that no one else is referencing the connection.
   * We can only ensure this in the rmmod path in the current code.
   */

The flag added below, and its comment in net/rds/rds.h, describe protection
for the non-rmmod case, and in-tree callers such as
rds_ib_cm_connect_complete() (net/rds/ib_cm.c) destroy a single connection
outside rmmod.  Later in this series "net/rds: split connection destroy into
quiesce and kref-governed free" replaces that comment, so is it worth
refreshing it here so the two do not disagree in between?

> +	 */

[Severity: Low]

Is the parenthetical "which all test rds_destroy_pending() under
rcu_read_lock()" accurate for the tree as it stands?  The same claim is made
unconditionally in the new struct rds_connection comment:

  /* ... A site that arms
   * a path work must test the predicate and queue the work inside
   * one rcu_read_lock() section: ...
   */

Three arming sites do neither.  rds_send_worker() and rds_recv_worker() in
net/rds/threads.c re-arm their own works with no predicate and no RCU
section:

	switch (ret) {
	case -EAGAIN:
		rds_stats_inc(s_send_immediate_retry);
		queue_delayed_work(cp->cp_wq, &cp->cp_send_w, 0);
		break;
	case -ENOMEM:
		rds_stats_inc(s_send_delayed_retry);
		queue_delayed_work(cp->cp_wq, &cp->cp_send_w, 2);
		break;

And rds_conn_path_drop() bypasses the predicate on purpose for destroy:

net/rds/connection.c:rds_conn_path_drop() {
	rcu_read_lock();
	if (!destroy && rds_destroy_pending(cp->cp_conn)) {
		rcu_read_unlock();
		return;
	}
	queue_work(cp->cp_wq, &cp->cp_down_w);
	rcu_read_unlock();
}

that being the call rds_conn_path_destroy() makes with destroy == true,
after c_destroy_in_prog has already been set.  The commit message does note
the worker self-requeues and the sync cancel that covers them, but the
in-tree comments do not mention either exception.  Could the comments spell
out that the workers and the destroy == true drop are covered by the sync
cancel and by the destroy path driving its own final shutdown pass instead?

> +	WRITE_ONCE(conn->c_destroy_in_prog, true);

[Severity: High]

Can the single-connection destroy this flag is written for actually
complete?  The RDMA CM handler holds conn->c_cm_lock (which is
conn->c_path[0].cp_cm_lock, see net/rds/rds_single_path.h) across the
ESTABLISHED dispatch:

net/rds/rdma_transport.c:rds_rdma_cm_event_handler_cmn() {
	if (conn) {
		mutex_lock(&conn->c_cm_lock);
	...
	case RDMA_CM_EVENT_ESTABLISHED:
		if (conn)
			trans->cm_connect_complete(conn, event);
		break;
	...
}

and the version-mismatch destroy runs from inside that dispatch:

net/rds/ib_cm.c:rds_ib_cm_connect_complete() {
	if (conn->c_version < RDS_PROTOCOL_VERSION) {
		if (conn->c_version != RDS_PROTOCOL_COMPAT_VERSION) {
			pr_notice(...);
			rds_conn_destroy(conn);
			return;
	...
}

rds_conn_destroy() then reaches rds_conn_path_destroy(), which queues
cp_down_w with the guard bypassed and waits for it while still holding
cp_cm_lock:

net/rds/connection.c:rds_conn_path_destroy() {
	rds_conn_path_drop(cp, true);	/* cp_state = RDS_CONN_ERROR, queue */
	flush_work(&cp->cp_down_w);
	...
}

The shutdown worker fails the DOWN to DOWN transition because the state is
RDS_CONN_ERROR, and then takes the mutex the flusher owns:

net/rds/connection.c:rds_conn_shutdown() {
	if (!rds_conn_path_transition(cp, RDS_CONN_DOWN, RDS_CONN_DOWN)) {
		...
		mutex_lock(&cp->cp_cm_lock);
	...
}

IB is not t_mp_capable, so npaths is 1 and the path being destroyed is
exactly the one whose cp_cm_lock is held.  ERROR to DISCONNECTING is only
performed under cp_cm_lock, so no other pass can unblock the transition
either.  Does this leave the CM event thread parked in flush_work() holding
cp_cm_lock and the path worker parked in mutex_lock() behind it, with the
peer-supplied CM private data (major 3, minor 0) as the trigger?

If so, the motivating scenario in the commit message, "queue_delayed_work()
on a cp_wq that destroy_workqueue() has already freed", would not be
reachable from this caller, because the destroy hangs before
destroy_workqueue() runs.

There is a related use-after-free on the same path at the handler tail:

net/rds/rdma_transport.c:rds_rdma_cm_event_handler_cmn() {
out:
	if (conn)
		mutex_unlock(&conn->c_cm_lock);
	...
}

which runs on memory already returned by kfree(conn->c_path) and
kmem_cache_free(rds_conn_slab, conn) in rds_conn_destroy().  That part is
addressed later in this series by "net/rds: pin the connection across
RDMA-CM event handling", but the lock re-entry above appears to survive to
the end of the series, where rds_conn_path_quiesce() still does
rds_conn_path_drop(cp, true) plus flush_work(&cp->cp_down_w) and
net/rds/ib_cm.c still calls rds_conn_destroy() from the CM callback.  Would
deferring that destroy out of the CM callback be the better fix for this
site?

>  	/* Ensure conn will not be scheduled for reconnect */
>  	spin_lock_irq(&rds_conn_lock);
>  	hlist_del_init_rcu(&conn->c_hash_node);
