These span 4 years.

Yes, if anything it proves that serious security issues are usually
on the datapath for networking, not what you're covering.

Easy to PoC stuff with LLMs these days. I'd like to hear from
an end user who would find these hooks useful, in more detail.
Anyone with an ounce of gray matter will run untrusted workloads
_at least_ in a VM today.

Please send the fixes along. The hash you mention requires
CAP_NET_ADMIN on a real interface, not a serious security
issue.
