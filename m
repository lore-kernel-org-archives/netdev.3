Yes, it should, and I have fixed it. For v3 I thread the instance through t=
he
walk and compare the back-pointer.

Your later comments about legs being keyed by net_device while their hardwa=
re
state is indexed by vid led to sparx5_rr_dev_real_is_vlan_aware() keying on
sparx5->hw_bridge_dev and the NETDEV_CHANGEADDR arm keying on whether that
bridge has legs. Both are inherently per-instance, so the code should handl=
e
the multi instance case properly.

It is not consistent, and yes it does. I am taking your first option and
dropping the #if.

Correct on all of it, I will retry on next leg creation and return

>=20

Yes, this is also right. For v3 the base  MAC is programmed from the VLANs
real device at leg creation, just before the leg is armed. The previous
checks have then ensured that the real device is a VLAN-aware bridge master
with a port of this instance below it. The driver only supports one bridge
as sparx5_port_bridge_join() rejects a second with -ENODEV.

>=20

Confirmed. In v3 the teardown will only depend on whether a leg exists,
which is the drivers own state and cannot be changed underneath it.

Rather than tracking vlan_filtering transitions, I will refuse a 1 -> 0
transition while legs are offloaded. br_vlan_filter_toggle() honours the
error and rolls its own state back.

The transition in the other direction will just not lead to offloading,
and the fib/neighbour objects will say so. Honouring fully dynamic
vlan_filtering transitions would require a lot of complicated logic to
always build up state in the driver, and then be able to apply/revert all
of it in hardware as the vlan_filtering changes.

Instead, simply expecting the bridge to be created with the desired
vlan_filtering up front saves a lot of complication.

It looks like there is prior art here, with mlxsw refusing the transition
unconditionally for any bridge it has offloaded:

drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlxsw/spectrum_switchdev.c:mlxsw_sp_port_attr=
_br_vlan_set() {
        if (bridge_device->vlan_enabled =3D=3D vlan_enabled)
                return 0;

        netdev_err(bridge_device->dev, "VLAN filtering can't be changed for=
 existing bridge\n");
        return -EINVAL;
}

Yes, this is a good catch. As far as I can tell, this configuration
is accepted, but not supported. br1 cannot work as a bridge on this
driver:
sparx5_set_rx_mode() only syncs the explicit multicast list for standalone =
ports
and ignores IFF_PROMISC and IFF_ALLMULTI entirely, so when br1 sets promisc=
uous
mode on eth0.5 and 8021q propagates that to eth0, nothing happens. A standa=
lone
port only delivers frames matching MAC table entries, so br1 never sees fra=
mes
for addresses it has not been told about. The VLAN demux itself is fine, si=
nce
vlan_do_receive() runs before rx_handler dispatch, but delivery to the CPU =
never
happens in the first place.

So this was never meant to be an accepted configuration. It is only accepte=
d
because the veto in sparx5_port_bridge_join() cannot see it.

Rather than add a vid uniqueness check, I am fixing the predicate, because =
the
weak test is the actual defect. Asking whether a sparx5 port exists somewhe=
re
below the bridge is true for a software bridge that merely has a vlan upper=
 of a
switch port enslaved, and such a bridge is not offloaded at all, so it must=
 never
host a leg.

I will also make sure legs are teared down when the last switch port leaves=
 the
bridge.

No, it was not enforced anywhere, and your second paragraph is the same roo=
t
cause as your previous comment: the recursive lower walk answers a weaker
question than the one that matters. Both arms now key on the bridge instead=
, so
the single-bridge restriction is enforced rather than assumed.


And I will make sure legs are cleaned up when the last switch port leaves t=
he
bridge.

Having legs on the bridge is exactly the condition under which the base MAC
is used for rewrites, so it is both the precise test and the one that
survives the bridge losing its ports.

Both correct, I will add both disable paths in v3.
