rds_conn_destroy() cancels the path works and then destroys the
per-path workqueue.  However, nothing currently stops the
work-requeueing sites from queueing new work on the connection while
that happens.  The existing code would suggest that this protection
is supposed to come from rds_destroy_pending(), since all of those
sites - apart from the workers' own self-requeues, which the sync
cancel in the destroy path already rejects, and the destroy == true
rds_conn_path_drop(), which the destroy itself issues and flushes and
IB device removal issues ahead of the module exit that destroys the
connection - guard the queueing with
rds_destroy_pending() under rcu_read_lock() (the last stragglers were
converted by the previous patch), and rds_conn_destroy() already issues a
synchronize_rcu() after unhashing the connection.  But the predicate
only tests for the two global teardown cases (netns destruction via
check_net(), module unload via ->t_unloading).  Because the conn
itself lacks any indication that a destroy is in progress, the
predicate does not cover the destruction of a single connection
outside these two cases.

One caller escapes both terms.  When the core rds module unloads,
rds_conn_exit() runs rds_loop_net_exit() first, and unregistering the
pernet operations invokes rds_loop_exit_net() -> rds_loop_kill_conns()
-> rds_conn_destroy() for the loopback connections of every network
namespace that is still alive: check_net() is true for all of them,
and the loop transport's unloading flag is only set afterwards, by
rds_loop_exit().  For the duration of those destroys the predicate is
false, so a concurrent rds_cong_queue_updates() can still find the
connection on the congestion map's m_conn_list (the conn is only
removed from it after the paths are torn down) and call
queue_delayed_work() on a cp_wq that destroy_workqueue() has already
freed.  Nothing can exploit that today: every socket pins the rds
module, so none exists by the time rds_exit() runs, and the works a
connection's own ordered workqueue re-arms are drained by
destroy_workqueue().  But the predicate is wrong for those destroys,
and the following patches need it to be right.

The predicate is also imprecise even where it is true: it answers "is
this connection's world going away", not "is this connection being
destroyed", and the following patches need the second answer.  Once
the free is deferred to the last reference, a connection can be
handed to rds_conn_destroy() more than once (the IB unload path
re-sweeps its list until every connection is gone) and must
recognise its own destroy in progress, and the passive-twin creation
must refuse a parent whose destroy has begun.

The cp_flags bit that once served this purpose, RDS_DESTROY_PENDING
from commit c90ecbfaf50d2 ("rds: Use atomic flag to track connections
being destroyed"), was only ever set on the IB protocol-version path
and lost its last set_bit in commit cdc306a5c9cd3 ("rds: make v3.1 as
compat version"); it never covered the loopback path above, which
commit c809195f5523 ("rds: clean up loopback rds_connections on netns
deletion") added.

Record the destroy on the connection itself, where every caller is
covered: set
conn->c_destroy_in_prog before the unhash + synchronize_rcu() sequence
in rds_conn_destroy() and test it first in rds_destroy_pending().  The
existing rcu_read_lock() around every check-and-queue site pairs with
that synchronize_rcu(): once it returns, every new reader observes the
flag and refuses to queue, and anything queued before it is flushed or
cancelled by the existing teardown.  Drop the now-unreferenced
RDS_DESTROY_PENDING bit and its dead test.

In the Oracle UEK kernel the equivalent conn->c_destroy_in_prog flag
is part of the larger connection refcounting rework ("net/rds: Add
krefs to struct rds_connection"), including ("net/rds: Merge uses of
conn->c_destroy_in_prog & RDS_DESTROY_PENDING").  This ports the
missing pieces of the requeue guard, which stand on their own.
