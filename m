tls: honor O_NONBLOCK in tls_sw_splice_read()

This patch makes tls_sw_splice_read() treat the socket's O_NONBLOCK as
nonblocking as well as SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK. The combined flag goes to
tls_rx_reader_lock(), tls_rx_rec_wait() and sock_rcvtimeo(). A
poll-then-splice loop on a nonblocking TLS socket then gets -EAGAIN
instead of sleeping.

> Poll makes the sleep reachable. tls_sw_sock_is_readable() reports
> the socket readable while any record sits on rx_list, including a
> zero-length record that delivers no bytes to the pipe. The
> strparser announces a record before decryption, when its plaintext
> length is unknown, so the readiness test cannot screen such a
> record out. The splice consumes it and waits for the next, and an
> event loop that polls and then splices stalls every connection it
> multiplexes.

> Fixes: c46234ebb4d1 ("tls: RX path for ktls")

[Severity: Medium]
Is c46234ebb4d1 the right commit to blame for this stall? It looks like
the previous patch in this series added the poll-then-splice sleep:
"tls: consume empty data records in tls_sw_splice_read()".

Before that patch, tls_sw_splice_read() had no retry loop. Also,
tls_sk_poll() only reports EPOLLIN when a record is parsed or rx_list is
non-empty:

net/tls/tls_main.c:tls_sk_poll() {
    ...
	if ((skb_queue_empty_lockless(&ctx->rx_list) &&
	     !tls_strp_msg_ready(ctx)) ||
	    READ_ONCE(ctx->key_update_pending))
		mask &= ~(EPOLLIN | EPOLLRDNORM);
    ...
}

So a single reader that polled and then spliced would either dequeue
from rx_list or reach tls_rx_rec_wait() with a record already parsed.
Either way it never slept. A zero-length record gave a false EOF, not a
hang.

The previous patch added this retry:

	if (rxm->full_len == 0) {
		consume_skb(skb);
		...
		goto retry;
	}

On retry, that patch calls tls_rx_rec_wait() with
flags & SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK. That value is false for an O_NONBLOCK socket
spliced into a blocking pipe. The wait then uses sk_rcvtimeo and sleeps
until the next record arrives.

This creates a bisect window between the two commits. In that window, a
peer that sends one empty application_data record and then goes quiet
can stall a poll/splice event loop.

Both commits also carry the same Fixes: tag. The earlier one applies on
its own, but this one rewrites the earlier one's signal_pending() branch
and can't apply without it. A stable backport of only the earlier
commit would turn the false EOF into a hang that a remote peer can
trigger.

Could this patch go before "tls: consume empty data records in
tls_sw_splice_read()" in the series? If not, could this commit message
say that the stall depends on that commit and that the two must be
backported together?
