net: stmmac: rework stmmac_rx to support XDP rx multi-buff

This reworks stmmac_rx() to accumulate all descriptors of a frame into a
single xdp_buff, so the XDP program runs on the full, possibly fragmented,
packet. A partial skb is no longer saved in rx_q->state across NAPI polls;
the in-progress xdp_buff is saved there instead. XDP_PASS frames are built
into an skb with napi_build_skb() and xdp_update_skb_frags_info(), and FCS
stripping moves to a new stmmac_xdp_shrink_tail() helper.

> Build the xdp_buff by accumulating all the descriptors that make up a

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but could the scope be stated more precisely? When XDP is
enabled, stmmac_xdp_set_prog() still rejects dev->mtu > ETH_DATA_LEN and
still turns off SPH:

	priv->sph_active = priv->sph_capable && !stmmac_xdp_is_enabled(priv);

So the program only sees fragmented xdp_buffs for oversized frames that the
MAC accepts at MTU 1500 through GMAC_CONFIG_JE or the XGMAC GPSL setting.

Would it help to say in the commit message that the jumbo MTU restriction
for XDP stays in place?

[Severity: Low]
Are these bullets accurate when compared with the parent tree?

On the leak claim: the parent stmmac_rx() built no xdp_buff frags. On
error it called dev_kfree_skb(skb) on an skb marked with
skb_mark_for_recycle(), which returns the attached page_pool frags.

On the truncation claim: the parent called
skb_add_rx_frag(skb, skb_shinfo(skb)->nr_frags, ...) with no bound, so it
would not have delivered a truncated frame.

On zero-length fragments: the parent already had the
"} else if (buf1_len) {" and "if (buf2_len) {" guards.

These read like changelog notes from an earlier revision of the patch.
Could they be reworded to describe the change against the current tree?

[Severity: Medium]
Can this pass a multi-buffer xdp_buff to an XDP program that was loaded
without BPF_F_XDP_HAS_FRAGS?

stmmac_build_xdp_frags() calls xdp_buff_add_frag(), which sets
XDP_FLAGS_HAS_FRAGS. stmmac_xdp_run_prog() then runs whatever program is
attached, and the driver never checks prog->aux->xdp_has_frags.
stmmac_xdp_set_prog() only gates the attach on MTU:

	if (prog && dev->mtu > ETH_DATA_LEN) {

These frames can still arrive at MTU 1500. GMAC_CORE_INIT always sets
GMAC_CONFIG_JE, XGMAC sets GPSL to XGMAC_JUMBO_LEN, and dma_buf_sz is 1536.
On cores with buffer2, a 1537 to 3072 byte frame fills buf1 and buf2 of one
descriptor and becomes a head plus one frag. Larger frames span several
descriptors.

A program that never opted in to frags sees only the head through
data/data_end, but its verdict applies to the whole frame.

Also, stmmac_dvr_probe() still advertises:

	ndev->xdp_features = NETDEV_XDP_ACT_BASIC | NETDEV_XDP_ACT_REDIRECT |
			     NETDEV_XDP_ACT_XSK_ZEROCOPY;

Should NETDEV_XDP_ACT_RX_SG be advertised here? And should programs
without xdp_has_frags either be rejected or kept away from frags-bearing
buffers?

[Severity: Medium]
What happens on XDP_TX when ctx.xdp carries frags? Does the frame go out
truncated to the head buffer?

The path is:

__stmmac_xdp_run_prog()
  stmmac_xdp_xmit_back()
    xdp_convert_buff_to_frame()
    stmmac_xdp_xmit_xdpf()

The converted frame keeps the frags flag, but xdpf->len covers only the
linear head. stmmac_xdp_xmit_xdpf() sets up one descriptor and marks it as
both first and last:

	stmmac_set_tx_dma_entry(tx_q, entry, buf_type, dma_addr, xdpf->len,
				false);
	stmmac_set_tx_dma_last_segment(tx_q, entry);
	...
	stmmac_prepare_tx_desc(priv, tx_desc, 1, xdpf->len,
			       csum, priv->descriptor_mode, true, true,
			       xdpf->len);

The frags are never mapped or queued, yet the action is counted as
successful. The EST SDU check also measures only the head:

	    xdpf->len > priv->est->max_sdu[queue]) {

The frag pages are not leaked, because stmmac_tx_clean() returns them via
xdp_return_frame_rx_napi().

Oversized XDP_TX frames were also truncated before this patch. The
difference is that the program now sees the whole frame and returns
XDP_TX for it.

Should frags-bearing frames be dropped on XDP_TX until
stmmac_xdp_xmit_xdpf() can transmit multiple descriptors?

> +
> +			/* Clear skb as it was set as status by

> +			 */
> +			frames = 0;

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but the comment still talks about clearing skb. The code
now resets frames instead, and skb is a loop-local variable that is never
cleared. Could the comment say that the in-progress frame state is being
dropped?
