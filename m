net: mana: keep per-queue statistics in the port context

This commit moves the per-queue RX/TX statistics out of the mana_rxq and
mana_txq objects and into port-lifetime arrays sized by max_queues. The
arrays are allocated at probe and freed after the netdev is unregistered.
ndo_get_stats64 and the ethtool stats now read from these arrays and keep
reporting while the port is down.

> replacement. Allocate max_queues slots before netdev registration,

> query.

[Severity: Low]
The message presents this as preparation for live queue replacement. Does
it also change behaviour that users can already see today?

Before this patch the RX/TX counters lived in mana_rxq and mana_txq. Those
are freed and reallocated on every mana_detach()/mana_attach(): ifdown/ifup,
MTU change, ethtool -L/-G, XDP install/remove, TX timeout reset and
suspend/resume. So the counters were reset each time. mana_get_stats64()
also returned early when !port_is_up.

After this patch the counters persist across all of those paths, and
mana_get_stats64() sums over max_queues instead of num_queues.

"Preserve counters while down" does hint at this. Could the message state
the change for the existing paths more explicitly?

Documentation/networking/statistics.rst asks for statistics to persist
across down/up. Would it make sense to split that part out as a separate
fix with a Fixes: tag?

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but can two CPUs update the
same xdp_xmit counter at the same time here?

mana_xdp_xmit() picks the slot with:

	q_idx = smp_processor_id() % ndev->real_num_tx_queues;

mana_xdp_tx() holds the TX queue lock only around mana_start_xmit():

	__netif_tx_lock(ndevtxq, smp_processor_id());
	rc = mana_start_xmit(skb, ndev);
	__netif_tx_unlock(ndevtxq);

So the xdp_xmit update after the loop runs without that lock.

Devmap bulk queues are per-CPU (bq_enqueue() in kernel/bpf/devmap.c). With
more CPUs than TX queues, two CPUs can flush to the same q_idx and run the
+= on the same counter concurrently. Doesn't that break the u64_stats rule
that writers of a given syncp must be mutually exclusive?

MANA depends on X86_64 || ARM64, so the seqcount compiles away and the only
effect is lost xdp_xmit counts. The baseline code has the same pattern,
and it is still there at the end of the series.

[Severity: Medium]
Is apc->max_queues stable enough to use as the bound here?

mana_alloc_queue_stats() sizes rxq_stats, rxq_stats_ret and txq_stats from
apc->max_queues at probe time, and that capacity is not stored anywhere
else.

mana_init_port() runs again on every mana_attach(), including the resume
path in mana_probe(), and it can lower max_queues:

	max_queues = min_t(u32, max_txq, max_rxq);
	if (apc->max_queues > max_queues)
		apc->max_queues = max_queues;
	if (apc->max_queues > gc->max_num_queues_vport)
		apc->max_queues = gc->max_num_queues_vport;

On resume, mana_gd_query_max_resources() recomputes the limits from:

	gc->max_num_queues = num_online_cpus();

So fewer online CPUs, or a smaller vPort max_txq/max_rxq, can shrink
max_queues, for example from 16 to 8. Slots 8..15 still hold accumulated
counts, but this loop stops summing them. The rtnl_link_stats64 RX/TX
totals would then go backwards, against the persistence rule in
Documentation/networking/statistics.rst.

Indexing stays in bounds because max_queues only shrinks after probe.

Would it be better to record the allocated slot count separately, or to
fold the excluded slots into a lifetime aggregate?

There is a related effect. mana_get_ethtool_stats(), along with the
sset_count and strings callbacks, still iterates over apc->num_queues.
After ethtool -L reduces the channel count, the ip -s link totals include
slots in [num_queues, max_queues) that ethtool -S never shows. The
per-queue values then no longer add up to the totals. Is that intended?

This code is still the same at the end of the series.
