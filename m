bridge: cfm: keep RX work disabled while CC is disabled

This patch initializes each peer MEP's ccm_rx_dwork in the disabled
state. It enables the work in cc_peer_enable() and switches
cc_peer_disable() to disable_delayed_work_sync(). The goal is to stop
br_cfm_frame_rx() from requeueing the RX work, and reporting a new loss
defect, after CC has been turned off.

[Severity: Medium]
This is a pre-existing issue and was not introduced by this patch, but it
is on the cc_peer_enable() path changed here. When br_cfm_cc_config_set()
calls ccm_rx_timer_start(), which exp_interval does it see?

br_cfm_cc_config_set() enables the peers before it stores the new config:

    if (config->enable && !mep->cc_config.enable)
        /* CC is enabled */
        hlist_for_each_entry(peer_mep, &mep->peer_mep_list, head)
            cc_peer_enable(peer_mep);
    ...
    mep->cc_config = *config;

ccm_rx_timer_start() then reads the old value:

    interval_us = interval_to_us(peer_mep->mep->cc_config.exp_interval);

On the first enable of a newly created MEP, cc_config is all zeroes. That
makes exp_interval BR_CFM_CCM_INTERVAL_NONE, so interval_to_us() returns 0
and the RX work is queued with a 0 jiffy delay.

If the kworker runs before mep->cc_config is updated, can
ccm_rx_work_expired() keep requeueing itself with a 0 delay? If so, it
could reach the miss limit and latch a spurious ccm_defect, with a
notification.

The same ordering matters when enable and an interval change arrive in
one request. For example, CC was disabled with a 10 min interval and is
now enabled with 3.3 ms. The first tick would then fire after a quarter
of the old interval, which delays loss detection by up to about 2.5
minutes.

Could the new config be stored before the peers are enabled?

[Severity: Medium]
Does this cover everything the commit message describes? The commit
message says:

    After CC is turned off, a valid CCM can still reach br_cfm_frame_rx(),
    clear the peer defect and restart its RX timer.

This change only prevents the timer restart. The CCM branch of
br_cfm_frame_rx() still does not check mep->cc_config.enable:

    /* A valid CCM frame is received */
    if (peer_mep->cc_status.ccm_defect) {
        peer_mep->cc_status.ccm_defect = false;

        /* Change in CCM defect status - notify */
        br_cfm_notify(RTM_NEWLINK, port);

        /* Start CCM RX timer */
        ccm_rx_timer_start(peer_mep);
    }

    peer_mep->cc_status.seen = true;
    peer_mep->ccm_rx_count_miss = 0;

cc_peer_disable() does not touch cc_status, so a ccm_defect latched
before CC was disabled stays set.

When a valid CCM arrives after that, won't br_cfm_frame_rx() still clear
the defect and send an RTM_NEWLINK notification for a MEP whose CC is
disabled? The only difference is that ccm_rx_timer_start() now does
nothing, because queue_delayed_work() refuses the disabled work.

A receive that is already in flight when br_cfm_cc_config_set() disables
CC seems to behave the same way. disable_delayed_work_sync() returns and
the request is acked, but the in-flight br_cfm_frame_rx() can still clear
the defect and notify.

The same path also keeps updating seen, ccm_rx_count_miss, rdi,
seq_unexp_seen, the TLV status and mep->ccm_rx_snumber.

Would it close the remaining gap to also gate the CCM processing branch
of br_cfm_frame_rx() on mep->cc_config.enable? Disabling the work would
still be needed for the in-flight requeue race.
