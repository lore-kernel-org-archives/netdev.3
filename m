TL;DR: Yes, I think this patchset can proceed and fixes for
       pre-existing issues can be addressed separately.

Thanks for the detailed feedback above, and likewise on patch 3/4.
It is much appreciated.

My view is that in the age of AI-generated review there is a risk that
making corrections pre-existing problems a pre-requisite risks perpetual
scope increase. So I think that that unless a pre-existing bug is made
materially worse, or fundamentally prevents a patch from reaching it's
goals, then fixing the pre-existing bug can be considered as follow-up.

Of course, drawing that line is a subjective matter.  But it seems to me
that the pre-existing issues flagged both here and in the review I
forwarded for 3/4 can be treated as follow-up.
