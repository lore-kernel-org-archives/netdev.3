The intent is for these attributes to represent device-
known clock quality information. The mechanism is
deliberately synchronization-agnostic: drivers may report
any attributes they can meaningfully vouch for, regardless
of how the clock is being disciplined. Thus a device that
genuinely knows a hardware error bound could report it even
if the PHC is being adjusted by ptp4l.

In practice, however, when a PHC is disciplined entirely
from userspace the driver often has little or no visibility
into synchronization quality. The valid bitmask is designed
for exactly this case: a driver advertises only the
attributes it can populate, so anything it cannot determine
is simply reported as unavailable.

That's an interesting direction for future PTP UAPI
evolution, and ynl does make that path easier than it used
to be. For this series I've kept to the existing PTP
userspace API model and extended the current timestamping
interfaces in a backwards-compatible way; a move to a
netlink family would be a broader subsystem effort and feels
separate from this work.

Regarding a "modified by userspace" mode, I wasn't
planning to add one. Whether adjtime() or adjfreq() was
invoked does not by itself describe the current
synchronization state or quality of the clock. A clock
disciplined from userspace may still be highly accurate. I'd
prefer to keep clock_status focused on clock quality
information that the driver can directly determine rather
than on how the clock is being controlled.

Agreed — a flags field would likely have scaled better. I
followed the existing ptp_clock_caps convention (one int per
capability) to stay consistent with the current UAPI
structure rather than mix two styles within the same struct.
