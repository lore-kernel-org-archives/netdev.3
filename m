net/rds: pin the connection across RDMA-CM event handling

This takes a reference on the connection found via cm_id->context for the
duration of rds_rdma_cm_event_handler_cmn(), ignoring the event if the
connection is already being freed, and re-checks rds_destroy_pending()
under c_cm_lock in rds_ib_cm_handle_connect() so a connect request cannot
install a new cm_id and QP on a connection that is only waiting for its
last reference.

[Severity: Medium]

The get_unless_zero/put pair itself looks balanced, but is the stated
reason for it accurate?  The comment says "what the callbacks below do may
drop the last reference other than ours", and the changelog says the same:

    Now that a connection is freed by its last reference, the remaining
    exposure is a callback that drops the last reference other than the
    handler's

Walking the callbacks dispatched from the switch below, none of them puts
a reference on the connection the handler just pinned.

cm_connect_complete -> rds_ib_cm_connect_complete() only drops the
connection on a version mismatch, and after commit f97d8c7bab78 that is
rds_conn_drop(), which takes no reference action:

net/rds/connection.c:rds_conn_path_drop() {
	atomic_set(&cp->cp_state, RDS_CONN_ERROR);

	rcu_read_lock();
	if (!destroy && rds_destroy_pending(cp->cp_conn)) {
		rcu_read_unlock();
		return;
	}
	queue_work(cp->cp_wq, &cp->cp_down_w);
	rcu_read_unlock();
}

cm_initiate_connect -> rds_ib_cm_initiate_connect() contains no put, and
the remaining switch arms only call rds_conn_drop().

cm_handle_connect -> rds_ib_cm_handle_connect() does call rds_conn_put(),
but that releases the reference rds_conn_create() handed to that same
function, and it runs after its own mutex_unlock(&conn->c_cm_lock).  On
RDMA_CM_EVENT_CONNECT_REQUEST the handler's conn is NULL anyway, since the
listener cm_id is created with a NULL context:

net/rds/rdma_transport.c:rds_rdma_listen() {
	cm_id = rdma_create_id(&init_net, handler, NULL,
			       RDMA_PS_TCP, IB_QPT_RC);
}

which is what BUG_ON(cm_id->context) in rds_ib_cm_handle_connect()
asserts, so nothing was pinned on that path.

That leaves holders outside the handler as the ones that can reach zero
concurrently - rds_conn_destroy() dropping the initial reference, a socket
dropping rs_conn, a c_passive drop, or an inc drop - which is a different
invariant than the one written down.  Could the comment and the changelog
name the holder that can actually race here, or say plainly that the pin
is defensive?  As written, a later reader auditing the callbacks will find
no put and may conclude the pin is dead code, and the same wording is what
a backporter would use to decide whether this is a fix or hardening.

I also checked the end of the series (fe1de9d527be84f2ab7fed636cc4915635b09f0d)
and the comment is unchanged there, so no later patch adjusts it.
