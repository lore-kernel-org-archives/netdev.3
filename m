Extend the stress script with tests that register and unregister
devices from several processes at once and that keep a number of
devices with many pins live at the same time, checking that every one
of them is visible on netlink.

The workers run in subshells, so the parent cannot track the device a
worker has in flight. Each worker removes it from its own exit trap
instead, and the parent reserves a range of clock IDs for every worker,
so that the devices of a worker cannot collide with those of another
worker or of the parent and whatever a killed worker left behind can
be removed by name, at the end of the test and from the cleanup
handler. The handler stops the recorded workers together with the jobs
of the shell, gives them a few seconds to run their exit traps before
forcing the survivors, and goes on without a worker that does not die,
since one stuck in the kernel would hang the teardown. Deleting a
device treats a part of it that is gone by the time its step runs as
removed, so that a removal running concurrently with the one of a
worker does not turn into a spurious failure. The workers inherit the
open lock file of the library, so the lock is held until the script
and every worker have exited.
