Well, the TC9563 should get powered ON when its pwrctrl driver gets probed and
the pci_pwrctrl_power_on_device() is called. There is no dependency with the
upstream port enumeration AFAIK.

Yeah, it does handle both power ON and some configuration for stable operation.

Yeah, more or less. If the Root Port is hotplug capable, PCI core will allocate
more resources like bridge windows and bus numbers in anticipation of devices
getting attached to it after boot. But that also sometimes becomes insufficient
if a resource hungry device like GPU gets plugged in later, as the PCI core can
only guess the memory for hotplug capable Root Port.

Yeah. If those GPIO lines are not used to power up any endpoint devices, then
there should be no issues. But this is something we cannot control as the board
designers can do whatever they want.

The driver confuses between ports and endpoint. TC9563_ETHERNET is not a port,
but an integrated endpoint. I've identified some issues while reviewing it now.
Will try to fix them asap.

Not all of the settings are applicable to all ports. Only ASPM and N_FTS are
applicable to all ports and endpoints, but the rest are optional. But the driver
treats all properties mandatory for all ports/endpoint, and safeguards itself by
having some absurd checks. This is something I'm going to fix.

The driver assumes only one endpoint, but the binding lists 2. So the driver is
not complying with its own binding now :/

So technically, the driver supports 2 integrated endpoints.

Both ASPM and N_FTS properties are applicable to ports and integrated endpoints
as well. But other 2, DFE and Tx Amplitude are only applicable to ports only,
excluding DSP3.
