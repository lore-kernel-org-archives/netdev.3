tcp: Add TCP ROCCET congestion control module.

This adds a new congestion control module, tcp_roccet, derived from CUBIC.
It adds a state machine (LAUNCH, ORBITER, RTT_PROBE, RTT_PROBE_REFILL,
DRAIN) driven by a relative RTT metric and an ACK arrival rate, and takes
over all window handling by registering the cong_control callback.

A few questions about the new module below.

The From: author of the patch is Tim Fuechsel, but the first Signed-off-by
in the chain is Lukas Prause and there is no Co-developed-by tag.

Per Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst, a contributor who is not

be reordered and a Co-developed-by added so the authorship of the new file

[Severity: Low]
Is the note above accurate? beta is one of the inputs to
param_precompute(), which derives beta_scale:

	beta_scale =
		8 * (BICTCP_BETA_SCALE + beta) / 3 / (BICTCP_BETA_SCALE - beta);

param_precompute() is only called from roccet_register(), yet beta is
registered with 0644 while the other precompute input, bic_scale, is 0444.
After a write to /sys/module/tcp_roccet/parameters/beta, the multiplicative
decrease used by roccet_congestion_event(), roccet_handle_recovery(),
roccet_recalc_ssthresh() and roccet_min_rtt_probe_ce() changes while
beta_scale keeps the load-time value.

Should beta be 0444 as well, or should the note be dropped?

[Severity: High]
Only the LAUNCH branch lowers snd_ssthresh here. For an event detected in
ORBITER, cwnd is cut by beta and the state becomes DRAIN with snd_ssthresh
left at the older, higher value.

About 100 ms later roccet_drain_update() picks the next state using exactly
that relation:

	if (!time_between32(now, ...)) {
		if (tcp_in_slow_start(tp))
			ca->state = LAUNCH;
		else
			ca->state = ORBITER;
	}

tcp_in_slow_start() is cwnd < snd_ssthresh, which is what the beta cut just
produced. Does the flow then re-enter LAUNCH, where roccet_launch_update()
calls tcp_slow_start() and re-inflates cwnd exponentially back to the
unchanged snd_ssthresh, undoing the reduction this function just made?

Should snd_ssthresh be lowered together with cwnd in the ORBITER case?

[Severity: Medium]
next_min_rtt_probe is a microsecond deadline everywhere else, and here it is
reused to hold a raw jiffies stamp. The conversion back happens only in
roccet_handle_state_transitions(), and only when the new state is ORBITER
and prev_state is RTT_PROBE or RTT_PROBE_REFILL:

		if ((prev_state == RTT_PROBE ||
		     prev_state == RTT_PROBE_REFILL)) {
			...
			roccet_set_next_min_rtt_probe_ts(ca);
		}

But an ECN/CWR event in RTT_PROBE_REFILL goes through
roccet_congestion_event(), whose else-if branch sets DRAIN, so the later
DRAIN to ORBITER transition has prev_state == DRAIN and the restore is
skipped. ORBITER then evaluates

	if (time_after32(now, ca->next_min_rtt_probe) &&

with now = jiffies_to_usecs(tcp_jiffies32) against a raw jiffies count
(about 1000 times smaller at HZ=1000). Does this either fire an immediate
extra min RTT probe right after the ECN-driven reduction, or defer probing
for up to about 36 minutes?

[Severity: Low]
The comment says the cwnd is halved, but probe_cwnd is max(cwnd / 3,
TCP_INIT_CWND) or max(cwnd / 2, TCP_INIT_CWND).

Small windows are reachable because roccet_congestion_event() and
roccet_handle_recovery() floor cwnd at 2. For cwnd below TCP_INIT_CWND, does
this raise the window (2 becomes 10) during a phase whose stated purpose is
to empty the bottleneck buffer, with roccet_min_rtt_probe() restoring the
smaller saved value afterwards?

[Severity: High]
Is ca->curr_rtt bounded before it is used as a timer duration here?

roccet_acked() stores the raw sample:

	if (sample->rtt_us > 0) {
		ca->last_rtt = ca->curr_rtt;
		ca->curr_rtt = sample->rtt_us;
	}

RTT samples are partly peer-controlled. When Karn's algorithm suppresses the
ACK-timing sample, tcp_ack_update_rtt() falls back to tcp_rtt_tsopt_us(),
which converts the peer-echoed TS-ECR value and accepts up to just under
INT_MAX microseconds:

net/ipv4/tcp_input.c:tcp_rtt_tsopt_us() {
	if (likely(delta < INT_MAX / (USEC_PER_SEC / TCP_TS_HZ))) {
		...
		delta_us = delta * (USEC_PER_SEC / TCP_TS_HZ);
		return delta_us;
	}
}

With a sample near 2.1e9 usec, interval becomes about 35 minutes,
probe_min_rtt_until = now + interval, and refill_until = now + 2 * interval
wraps u32 into the past. roccet_min_rtt_probe()'s

	else if (time_before32(now, ca->probe_min_rtt_until))
		return;

then keeps the flow in RTT_PROBE with the reduced cwnd and no growth path
for that whole period. The same input overflows
ca->next_srrtt_check_ts = now + 5 * ca->curr_rtt in roccet_orbiter_update()
and roccet_handle_state_transitions(), and roccet_xj truncates a u64
division into u32.

Should curr_rtt be clamped to a sane maximum before being used as a
duration and a multiplier?

[Severity: Medium]
If the application idles during RTT_PROBE or RTT_PROBE_REFILL, this adds the
idle delta to epoch_start. When probing completes,
roccet_handle_state_transitions() adds the entire elapsed probe duration to
the same field, with no clamp:

			if (ca->epoch_start != 0)
				ca->epoch_start += tcp_jiffies32 -
						   ca->next_min_rtt_probe;

Can the idle interval be counted twice and leave epoch_start after
tcp_jiffies32? bictcp_update() then does

	t = (s32)(tcp_jiffies32 - ca->epoch_start);

with t declared u64, so a negative difference widens into a very large
value and offs/delta and ca->cnt become meaningless.

Also, while epoch_start is in the future, does roccet_acked() discard every
RTT sample through

	if (ca->epoch_start && (s32)(tcp_jiffies32 - ca->epoch_start) < HZ)
		return;

right after the probe whose purpose was to measure the minimum RTT?

> +	    (!tcp_is_cwnd_limited(sk) && ca->initial_limit_reached)) {

[Severity: High]
ca->initial_limit_reached is only set in roccet_control() when
tcp_is_cwnd_limited(sk) is true.

For a flow that sends one small segment at a time, tcp_is_cwnd_limited() in
slow start requires cwnd < 2 * max_packets_out, so it stays false,
initial_limit_reached never becomes true, and neither exit condition can
fire. tcp_slow_start() below then keeps adding acked to cwnd on every ACK up
to snd_cwnd_clamp.

Because this module registers cong_control, the stack's own
application-limited fallback is skipped:

net/ipv4/tcp_output.c:tcp_cwnd_validate() {
	...
		if (READ_ONCE(sock_net(sk)->ipv4.sysctl_tcp_slow_start_after_idle) &&
		    (s32)(tcp_jiffies32 - tp->snd_cwnd_stamp) >= inet_csk(sk)->icsk_rto &&
		    !ca_ops->cong_control)
			tcp_cwnd_application_limited(sk);
}

CUBIC returns early from its cong_avoid when !tcp_is_cwnd_limited(sk).
Should LAUNCH have an equivalent guard, so cwnd is not grown far past
anything the application ever used and then burst out on a later bulk write?

[ ... ]

[Severity: Medium]
tcp_slow_start() is called without first checking tcp_in_slow_start(), but
its ACK accounting assumes the caller is below ssthresh:

net/ipv4/tcp_cong.c:tcp_slow_start() {
	u32 cwnd = min(tcp_snd_cwnd(tp) + acked, tp->snd_ssthresh);

	acked -= cwnd - tcp_snd_cwnd(tp);
	tcp_snd_cwnd_set(tp, min(cwnd, tp->snd_cwnd_clamp));

	return acked;
}

After an RTO, tcp_enter_loss() has stored snd_ssthresh =
roccet_recalc_ssthresh() = max(cwnd * beta / 1024, 2), which is below 10 for
any pre-loss cwnd of about 14 or less, and roccet_state() then sets state =
LAUNCH with cwnd = TCP_INIT_CWND.

On the next ACK, with cwnd 10 and ssthresh 7, does the subtraction underflow
so the returned acked is inflated by (cwnd - ssthresh), and does cwnd get
dragged back down to ssthresh, undoing the TCP_INIT_CWND restore? The
inflated value is then stored in ca->ack_carry_over and later credited to
bictcp_update() and tcp_cong_avoid_ai() in ORBITER.

[Severity: High]
All ROCCET deadlines are u32 microsecond snapshots of
jiffies_to_usecs(tcp_jiffies32), so time_before32()/time_after32() are only
meaningful for offsets below 2^31 usec, about 36 minutes.

The test above is an unbounded half-range check, while roccet_drain_update()
uses a bounded window for the same pair of timestamps:

	if (!time_between32(now, ca->roccet_last_event_time_us
				- 100 * USEC_PER_MSEC,
				ca->roccet_last_event_time_us
				+ 100 * USEC_PER_MSEC)) {

With D = now - roccet_last_event_time_us in (2^31 + 100000, 2^32), the first
test is true and the second is false. Do the two handlers then assign each
other's state on every ACK, so the connection never reaches
bictcp_update()/tcp_cong_avoid_ai() and cwnd growth plus bufferbloat
detection stay frozen for up to another 36 minutes?

last_event_time_set is only cleared by roccet_reset() on RTO, so a
long-lived connection that had one congestion event and then idled seems to
be enough.

The same range also affects the probe states: roccet_min_rtt_probe()'s
time_before32(now, ca->probe_min_rtt_until) reads as "still probing" again,
and roccet_rtt_probe_refill()'s time_after32(now, ca->refill_until) stays
false, leaving cwnd pinned at the reduced probe value with no growth path in
those states.

Do the comments claiming these checks handle wrap-arounds hold for offsets
above 2^31 usec? The changelog lists "Fix DRAIN-state stuck due to
idle-periods & wrap arounds" for v7 - does that fix cover this case?

[Severity: Low]
sent and received are each reduced modulo 2^32 and then compared as plain
magnitudes rather than as a wrap-safe difference.

If an interval (5 * curr_rtt) transfers about 4 GiB so the sequence space
straddles the wrap, sent comes out small while received is near UINT_MAX, so
an increase in outstanding data is missed; the reverse ordering reports one
that did not happen. This value gates both the congestion-event detection
and whether CUBIC growth runs.

Would a signed form such as (s32)(sent - received) > guard be safe here?
This needs an extreme bandwidth-delay product, but the comment above claims
the unsigned subtraction makes the check wrap-safe.

roccet_control() dispatches purely on ca->state and never inspects
inet_csk(sk)->icsk_ca_state. Since cong_control is provided, the core's
reduction machinery does not run at all:

net/ipv4/tcp_input.c:tcp_cong_control() {

While the connection is in TCP_CA_Recovery or TCP_CA_CWR, does the switch in
roccet_control() still reach roccet_orbiter_update() and grow cwnd here on
the very ACKs that repair losses? During recovery tp->is_cwnd_limited is
commonly true and snd_una advances faster than snd_nxt, so neither of the
two early returns above applies.

The only reduction is the single beta cut in roccet_handle_recovery() at
recovery entry, and nothing keeps the window reduced for the rest of the
episode. DRAIN is also only entered from roccet_congestion_event(), so a
plain fast-retransmit recovery never sets roccet_last_event_time_us and
there is no drain period after real loss.

Should growth be skipped while tcp_in_cwnd_reduction(sk) is true, and could
the commit message state that PRR/packet conservation is replaced?

[Severity: Medium]
Can beta be applied twice to the same window on a CWR to Recovery
transition?

An ECN mark first enters TCP_CA_CWR, where roccet_state() calls
roccet_congestion_event() and reduces cwnd to max(cwnd * beta / 1024, 2). If
loss is then detected before that reduction episode ends, the core skips a
second reduction episode but still issues the state notification:

net/ipv4/tcp_input.c:tcp_enter_recovery() {
	if (!tcp_in_cwnd_reduction(sk)) {
		if (!ece_ack)
			tp->prior_ssthresh = tcp_current_ssthresh(sk);
		tcp_init_cwnd_reduction(sk);
	}
	tcp_set_ca_state(sk, TCP_CA_Recovery);
}

So the ssthresh callback is not re-run and snd_ssthresh stays at the CWR
value, while roccet_handle_recovery() multiplies the already reduced window
by beta again: 1024 to 717 on CWR, then to 502 on Recovery, with
snd_ssthresh still at 717. In RTT_PROBE the duplicate cut lands on the saved
restoration window via roccet_min_rtt_probe_ce().

The changelog lists "Fix potential double penalty when receiving ECN (ECE)
mark" for v3 - does that also cover the CWR to Recovery transition?

> +	} else if (new_state == TCP_CA_CWR) {

[Severity: High]
tcp_enter_loss() sets the loss window before notifying the module:

net/ipv4/tcp_input.c:tcp_enter_loss() {
	...
	tcp_snd_cwnd_set(tp, tcp_packets_in_flight(tp) + 1);
	...
	tcp_set_ca_state(sk, TCP_CA_Loss);
}

Does the assignment above replace that one-segment window with 10 segments
on every timeout?

roccet_reset() also forces ca->state = LAUNCH, and in LAUNCH loss is
deliberately ignored: roccet_recalc_ssthresh() returns the unreduced cwnd
when the state is LAUNCH, and roccet_handle_recovery() returns cwnd
unchanged. Since cong_control is registered, the core never applies its own
reduction either.

On repeated timeouts, for example a blackholing path or a peer that keeps
the flow in timeout, does the sender stay at a 10 segment floor and never
lower snd_ssthresh? Any application can select this module with
setsockopt(TCP_CONGESTION).

roccet_reset() additionally clears last_max_cwnd and delay_min, so all CUBIC
memory is dropped. The same TCP_CA_Loss path is also reached from
tcp_simple_retransmit() on MTU probe failure.

The commit message only says ROCCET "reacts to packet loss by adapting
CUBIC's behavior" - could it describe this loss policy explicitly?

[Severity: Medium]
The comment describes the policy in terms of LAUNCH and ORBITER, but the
code never reads ca->state and branches only on cwnd < snd_ssthresh / 2.

Two cases where the two differ, given that ROCCET manipulates cwnd and
snd_ssthresh independently:

In the RTT_PROBE states, roccet_enter_min_rtt_probe() cuts cwnd to about a
third while snd_ssthresh is left untouched, so cwnd < snd_ssthresh / 2 holds
and the multiplier becomes sysctl_tcp_pacing_ss_ratio (200 by default) in
the phase whose documented purpose is to drain the bottleneck buffer. The
same applies right after an RTO, where cwnd is forced to 10 while
snd_ssthresh keeps the pre-loss value.

In the second half of LAUNCH, with cwnd between snd_ssthresh / 2 and
snd_ssthresh, the pacing is 100%, not the documented 200%.

Should this branch consult ca->state, or should the comment be adjusted to
match the implementation?

[Severity: Medium]
When the idle check fires, this branch clears ack_rate_cnt but never
adds the acked value passed in for the current ACK. The other two
branches both count it. The regular rollover branch seeds the new
interval with min_t(u32, acked, U16_MAX), and the non-elapsed branch
accumulates it. That leaves the idle path as the only one that drops
the ACKs which triggered it.

The first ACK after more than 2 seconds of idle is often the largest
one in the interval. Examples are a cumulative ACK for data queued
before the idle period, or a stretch ACK after GRO.

Those segments are then missing from the count that becomes
curr_ack_rate at the next rollover, so that interval under-reports the
ACK arrival rate. At the rollover after that, ack_rate_last_rate holds
the undercounted value, which inflates get_ack_rate_diff().

roccet_launch_update() only takes the srRTT based LAUNCH exit when that
diff is at most ack_rate_diff_ss. Can this skew hold a flow in LAUNCH
for an extra interval right after idle?

The comment above says the counting is reset "as if a new connection
was created". However, after roccet_reset() the first ACK takes one of
the other two branches and is counted. Should this branch also set
ack_rate_cnt to min_t(u32, acked, U16_MAX)?

Separately, last_ack_rate_time is recomputed from tcp_jiffies32 here,
while roccet_control() already passes the same value in as now. Is
there a reason not to use now?
