Subject: [PATCH net-next v5 0/4] net: mana: concurrent HWC requests and dynamic queue depth
Date: Mon,  7 Sep 2026 20:51:54 -0700

This series enables concurrent MANA Hardware Channel (HWC) requests and
rebuilds the depth-one bootstrap queues at the device-reported maximum,
capped at 128. The first two patches provide handover and per-slot
ownership state; the last two add concurrency and dynamic depth.

Version history follows the original combined submission through its
split: v3 was a fixes-only net posting, while v4 and v5 here are the
standalone net-next feature series. The separate net v4-v8 iterations
are not revisions of this four-patch series and are not prerequisites.
Patch numbers in each entry refer to that version.

Changes in v5 (v4 -> v5):
 - Patches 1-2: shorten comments and describe the existing error-path
   changes, including teardown polling and query-only zero-timeout
   filtering. No executable changes from v4 in these patches.
 - Patch 3: reject apparent success from a response accepted before the
   request was submitted, preserving an existing cancellation error.
 - Patch 4: guard CQ unpublishing when establishment failed before
   allocating cq_table.
 - Patch 4: after an initial destroy failure, require successful retry
   teardown before creating fresh bootstrap queues. Do not test the old
   queues with uncertain mappings.
 - Clarify publication and locking scope, dimension acceptance, and the
   missing-doorbell guard's limits. Shorten all commit messages.

Changes in v4 (return to net-next after the v3 split):
 - Rework the feature series into four standalone patches: handover
   tracking, per-slot completion state, concurrent requests and dynamic
   queue depth. No dependency on the separate net fixes.
 - Patch 1: record submission in mana_smc_setup_hwc() itself, including
   failure after handover, rather than using max_num_cqs as the gate.
 - Patch 2: separate per-slot ownership from concurrency; make error
   signed, handle a response racing timeout, and ignore zero timeout-
   query replies while leaving asynchronous updates unchanged.
 - Patch 3: use bounded semaphore admission, guarded sender accounting,
   and per-request timeout quarantine rather than a channel-wide latch.
   Retain quarantine for zero-timeout cleanup.
 - Patch 4: cap depth at 128, round message buffers to a power of two,
   and require bootstrap message sizes before growing the queues.
   Retain the full 24-bit depth in u32 and check allocation bounds.
 - Patch 4: reset dimensions/routing IDs for each establish; check for a
   missing doorbell after the handshake; validate rebuilt dimensions.
   Retry teardown before bootstrap recovery after failed re-establishment.
 - Base the four-patch series on net-next 1bb784eb6e38.

Changes in v3 (v2 -> net v3, historical fixes-only posting):
 - Split the combined series after maintainer feedback. Post six fixes
   to net and defer the concurrent-request and dynamic-depth features.
 - Add a separate stale-response patch with per-slot ownership,
   buffer withdrawal, a channel timeout latch and zero-event filtering.
 - Remove the pcie_flr()-based teardown fallback; retain HWC resources
   when teardown cannot be confirmed.
 - Patch 2: publish queue dimensions before creating the CQ so the RX
   path has its stride and slot bound.
 - Rebase on net af39eb111ce6 and clarify messages/comments.
 These describe the historical net submission, not additional fixes
 carried by the current net-next series.

Changes in v2 (v1 -> v2):
 - Patch 4: bounds-check the SGE pointer derived from inline OOB size
   before dereferencing it.
 - Patch 6: protect active-sender accounting with hwc_lock and drain via
   wait_event_lock_irq(), so the last wakeup cannot access freed gc.
 - Patch 6: force-complete and drain senders before teardown/FLR handling,
   including its failure exits.
 - Rebase on net-next e354f7d60f14 and keep code within 80 columns.

v1 (initial submission):
 - Seven patches combined CQ-table lifetime, RQ/SQ sizing, completion-
   buffer teardown, RX validation and HWC teardown fixes with concurrent
   requests and dynamic queue depth.
 - Base: net-next f6f3b36c15ed.

The v4 admission and quarantine policies are unchanged: FIFO admission has
its own timeout and may trigger recovery on contention; zero-timeout
cleanup still retains slots for outstanding requests. Existing IRQ/DMA
teardown and service-lifetime issues remain outside this revision.

The series remains based on net-next commit 1bb784eb6e38. It does not
require the abandoned net v8 series.

Tested on Azure: each commit's MANA Ethernet/RDMA build; three PCI cycles;
queue-count, MTU and link changes; and bidirectional 16-stream, 60-second
TCP traffic. Synthetic timeout and bootstrap-fallback recovery were also
exercised. RDMA coverage was enumeration, not verbs traffic.
