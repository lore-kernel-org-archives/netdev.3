net/rds: wait for connections to be freed on transport unload

This adds a per-transport live connection count (t_conn_count) that is
incremented when a connection is published in __rds_conn_create() and
decremented at the end of rds_conn_destroy_fini().  The transport exit
paths then call a new rds_conn_wait_conns_freed() helper that waits, with
a 10 second bound, for that count to drop to zero before unloading.

[Severity: Medium]

A question about the ordering of this series rather than this hunk itself.

The commit "net/rds: split connection destroy into quiesce and kref-governed
free" is described as functionally equivalent, since the initial reference is
still the only one, so the free continues to happen inline in
rds_conn_destroy().

The commit "net/rds: hold connection references in lookup, sockets and
c_passive" appears to be the first point at which rds_conn_lookup(), rs_conn
and c_passive hold real references, i.e. the first point at which
rds_conn_destroy() can return with c_trans->conn_free() still pending.

The wait that covers that window only arrives here, one commit later.  Does
the tree therefore pass through a state where rmmod rds_tcp / rmmod rds_rdma
racing a pending free has no barrier at all?  Would it make sense to place
this wait ahead of (or squash it into) the commit that adds the extra
reference holders, or at least mention the dependency in that commit
message?

[Severity: High]

Is the use-after-free this patch describes still reachable through the
timeout branch of rds_conn_wait_conns_freed()?

The helper returns void, so on expiry it warns and returns, and none of the
three callers can react.  Teardown then continues unconditionally:

  rds_tcp_exit()
	rds_conn_wait_conns_freed(&rds_tcp_transport);	/* may time out */
	rds_trans_unregister(&rds_tcp_transport);
	rds_tcp_recv_exit();
	kmem_cache_destroy(rds_tcp_conn_slab);

  rds_ib_exit()
	rds_conn_wait_conns_freed(&rds_ib_transport);	/* may time out */
	...
	rds_ib_recv_exit();		/* destroys rds_ib_incoming_slab,
					 * rds_ib_frag_slab */
	rds_trans_unregister(&rds_ib_transport);
	rds_ib_mr_exit();

  rds_loop_exit() returns into rds_exit()/rds_conn_exit(), which destroys
  rds_conn_slab.

When the pending free finally runs, rds_conn_destroy_fini() does two things
that touch the unloaded module:

	for (i = 0; i < npaths; i++)
		rds_conn_path_free(&conn->c_path[i]);	/* -> c_trans->conn_free() */
	...
	if (!atomic_dec_return(&trans->t_conn_count))

The first is an indirect call into freed module text; the second is a write
into the module's freed data image.  For TCP the deferred
rds_tcp_conn_free() also lands in kmem_cache_free() on the already destroyed
rds_tcp_conn_slab, and for IB rds_ib_recv_free_caches() frees into slabs
destroyed by rds_ib_recv_exit().

The comment added on t_conn_count in rds.h says unload "has to wait for this
to reach zero", and the commit message says "if it expires anyway, warn - the
pending frees will touch freed module text".  Since a WARN is a diagnostic
rather than synchronisation, would an unbounded wait, a per-connection
module reference on trans->t_owner, or moving the transport-owned frees off
the asynchronous path be a better fit here?

As a side effect, does rmmod now block for up to 10 seconds, and does the
WARN take down machines running with panic_on_warn=1?

[Severity: High]

Can the deferred free write into an already popped stack frame?

The wait is placed after rds_tcp_destroy_conns() and
rds_ib_destroy_nodev_conns() have returned, so it cannot keep their
stack-local list heads alive:

net/rds/tcp.c:rds_tcp_destroy_conns() {
	LIST_HEAD(tmp_list);
	...
		if (!list_has_conn(&tmp_list, tc->t_cpath->cp_conn))
			list_move_tail(&tc->t_tcp_node, &tmp_list);
	...
	list_for_each_entry_safe(tc, _tc, &tmp_list, t_tcp_node)
		rds_conn_destroy(tc->t_cpath->cp_conn);
}

Entries whose free is deferred stay linked in tmp_list, and
t_tcp_node_detached is left false, so the deferred free later does:

net/rds/tcp.c:rds_tcp_conn_free() {
	spin_lock_irqsave(&rds_tcp_conn_lock, flags);
	if (!tc->t_tcp_node_detached)
		list_del(&tc->t_tcp_node);
	spin_unlock_irqrestore(&rds_tcp_conn_lock, flags);
	...
}

For an entry adjacent to the dead &tmp_list head, list_del() writes two
pointers into that popped frame, while the exit thread is sitting in
rds_conn_wait_conns_freed() -> wait_event_timeout() -> schedule_timeout()
on the same stack region.

The IB side is the same shape, with an unconditional list_del():

net/rds/ib_rdma.c:rds_ib_destroy_nodev_conns() {
	LIST_HEAD(tmp_list);
	spin_lock_irq(&ib_nodev_conns_lock);
	list_splice(&ib_nodev_conns, &tmp_list);
	spin_unlock_irq(&ib_nodev_conns_lock);
	...
}

net/rds/ib_cm.c:rds_ib_conn_free() {
	spin_lock_irq(lock_ptr);
	list_del(&ic->ib_node);
	spin_unlock_irq(lock_ptr);
	...
}

Note that rds_conn_destroy_fini() calls conn_free() before decrementing
t_conn_count, so the exit thread cannot observe completion ahead of the
write.  A conn already marked c_destroy_in_prog is guaranteed not to be
freed inside the destroy loop, since rds_conn_destroy() returns immediately
for it.

Would moving the wait inside the destroy helpers, or splicing onto a
non-stack list head, address this?  rds_loop_exit() looks safe only
incidentally, because its tmp_list and the wait share one frame.  The same
pattern appears in rds_tcp_kill_sock() and rds_loop_kill_conns() on netns
teardown.

[Severity: High]

Does this call site meet the precondition stated in the new helper's
comment, that it is called "after the transport destroyed all of its
connections"?

Connections still attached to a device do not appear to be destroyed by
either preceding call.  ib_unregister_client() -> rds_ib_remove_one() ->
rds_ib_dev_shutdown() only queues work:

net/rds/ib.c:rds_ib_dev_shutdown() {
	spin_lock_irqsave(&rds_ibdev->spinlock, flags);
	list_for_each_entry(ic, &rds_ibdev->conn_list, ib_node)
		rds_conn_path_drop(&ic->conn->c_path[0], true);
	spin_unlock_irqrestore(&rds_ibdev->spinlock, flags);
}

and rds_conn_path_drop() does queue_work(cp->cp_wq, &cp->cp_down_w) on the
per-path ordered workqueue, which the flush_workqueue(rds_wq) inside
rds_ib_unregister_client() does not drain.

An rds_ib_connection whose cp_down_w has not completed rds_ib_conn_shutdown()
-> rds_ib_remove_conn() is still on rds_ibdev->conn_list rather than
ib_nodev_conns, and rds_ib_destroy_nodev_conns() only walks ib_nodev_conns:

net/rds/ib_rdma.c:rds_ib_destroy_nodev_conns() {
	spin_lock_irq(&ib_nodev_conns_lock);
	list_splice(&ib_nodev_conns, &tmp_list);
	spin_unlock_irq(&ib_nodev_conns_lock);

	list_for_each_entry_safe(ic, _ic, &tmp_list, ib_node)
		rds_conn_destroy(ic->conn);
}

If such a connection's initial reference is never dropped, can t_conn_count
ever reach zero?  That would make the 10 second stall plus WARN the ordinary
outcome of rmmod rds_rdma with live IB connections, leave the module unloaded
with a live connection, and leak the rds_ib_connection along with its device
reference (so rds_ib_dev_free() never runs and the PD and MR pools are never
released).

Would draining the per-path workqueues, or destroying the per-device
conn_lists, before waiting cover these connections?
