That's what the rc cycle is for. I'm not asking for changes to behavior
of the hooks to accommodate anything. I'm requesting to make them do
what they were written to do while I was wiring up a consumer.

Because I sent fixes instead of a bug report. With Fixes: tags, with
reproducers in the commit messages and with tests, before rc1 even
exists. If that's too late to fix a hook that is new this cycle then
nothing can ever be fixed before it's released. Which makes no sense. We
do this all the time.

Yes, they're new. That's the argument for fixing them now. Not against
it. No released kernel has these hooks. Once v7.4 is out every one of
these fixes is a behavior change in a released kernel, needs a stable
backport that by your own rules doesn't qualify.

And on top of that nonsense, userspace has to probe for it forever.

Your README says "serious problems", not panics. A hook that is
exported to bpf as an attach point and never called is a serious
problem for an API.

And it's not how you've handled this before: lsm_get_self_attr() was new
in v6.8 and got fixed for apparmor and selinux at v6.8-rc7 (cf. [2]).
v7.1-rc5 took Stephen's cred_guard_mutex change for lsm_set_self_attr()
without a crash see (cf. [3]).

The series comes with a verifier test and a lifecycle test for exactly
that. Daniel ran it and needs it too. Alexei acked it and asked for the
whole series. There's nothing left that waiting for v7.5 would test.

Nothing in it changes anything for Landlock either.

No. That's a change to kernel/bpf/bpf_lsm.c which you don't maintain
and the people who do have acked the fixes and asked for the whole
series in v7.4.

You're proposing to rip working functionality out of someone else's code
so you don't have to take a three line deletion. namespace_init and
namespace_install work fine for bpf.

It's also not simpler. The LSM part of this series is deleting three
lines I wrote in security.c. The rest is my code and bpf's code with
acks. Your version needs a revert in v7.5 so it's two cross-tree changes
instead of one.

That's not what happened. Stephen posted the fix on September 16, v3 on
September 18. I reviewed it on September 25 and offered to carry it in
the namespace tree for v7.4.

On September 29 you said you'd rather take it through lsm/dev. It's not
in lsm/dev. It's not in v7.4. A reviewed fix that was ready three weeks
before the merge window didn't get applied. That's the same decision
you're making now and it's not a precedent for it.

> I told you "next merge window", which is far from "no".

For v7.4 it is "no". That's the release these hooks go out in. It means
v7.4 ships with a namespace_free hook that never fires and v7.4.y stays
that way because by your own rules the fix doesn't qualify for stable.

> I'll admit to finding it odd that you seem to keep inserting yourself
> into that friction point

A large portion of code where new security functionality is added or
modified all of the time is maintained by me and others. There's
multiple series each cycle that somehow are related to either bpf or the
security layer. What do you expect to happen? That people sit on the
sidelines and write encouraging haikus from time to time while this
friction is grinding any progress to a halt?

Given that I have Acks from both Alexei and Daniel and there's literally
a trivial deletion in kernel/security.c and everything else is in
namespace code, I will send this as part of the first round of vfs fixes
if I have to.

You're objection is noted and I'll mention it to Linus and then he can
decide.
