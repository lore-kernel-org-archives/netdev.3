We are now ready to send version 3 of this series.  It has undergone
a complete restructuring, though many detailed bits of code remain
the same as before.  Because of this we intend to use a new strategy
in posting the code for review.  I describe that here; if you think
there are things we could do differently to improve this process,
please say so.

I can provide a longer explanation for how the new model works if
that is requested, but here is a summary of the process:
- There will be no "version 3" of the original series.
- Instead, the TC9564 will be treated as an SoC that consists
   of a set of distinct components (clock, reset, interrupts,
   GPIO, etc.).
- Support for each of these components will be provided by
   distinct platform device drivers.
- These platform drivers will be upstreamed independently.
   I.e., the clock driver will be sent to clock maintainers for
   review, the reset driver will be sent to reset maintainers,
   and so on.
- One of these platform drivers will provide support for the
   XGMAC 10 Gbit Ethernet interface (whose support was the
   the original, primary goal of this series).
- The anchor driver is a PCI endpoint/function driver, which
   implements the framework necessary to support the pci-ep-bus
   that all the other devices use for their MMIO.

We will send the code for all of these parts out for review
separately.  Upstreaming each can proceed independently, and
when all are eventually accepted (including devicetree updates),
the originally-desired XGMAC functionality will be supported.

Here is a list of the "components":
- PCI driver (drivers/misc/tc9564-pci.c)
- Clock driver (drivers/clk/clk-tc9564.c)
- Reset driver (drivers/reset/reset-tc9564.c)
- Interrupt controller driver (drivers/irqchip/irq-tc9564-msigen.c)
- Address translation unit driver (drivers/misc/tc9564-translate.c)
- XGMAC driver (drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/dwmac-tc9564.c)

There was previously a GPIO driver included.  That has been
reimplemented to be accessed via I2C rather than PCIe BARs.
The new version will be associated with the PCI pwrctl driver,
pci-pwrctrl-tc9563.c, and will be posted for review separately.

>    - The GPIO controller is now implemented using regmap-gpio
>    - The Kconfig entry for the GPIO driver has been updated to select
>      GPIO_REGMAP, and to define its default value as "m" unconditionally
>    - The Kconfig entry is now defined in the memory-mapped GPIO section
>    - The regmap use has been adjusted so it's clear it is MMIO-based,
>      which normally does not require error checking.
>    - We no longer call drv_get_drvdata()
> 
> PATCH 10/12
>    - The name of the IRQ domain now includes the MAC ID (0 or 1)
>    - SP_SEL_SGMII_2500M is now named SP_SEL_2500BASEX
>    - A typo in the commit has been fixed, and the error check after creating
>      the RX IRQ mapping now checks the right pointer for an error
>    - The Kconfig entry now selects GENERIC_IRQ_CHIP
>    - The PHY interface is now taken into account in the fix_max_speed
>      callback
>    - We now check the correct pointer for an error when creating the RX
>      IRQ mappings
>    - We are not implementing a shutdown driver callback
>    - Xilin has other discussion related to WoL, which we should save
>      and use, but we're not acting on it now.
>    - In four function, Sashiko noted that a 32-bit dma_addr_t can't hold
>      TC956X_SLV00_SRC_ADDR, so the type of local variable has been changed
>      to be u64: tc956x_dma_init_rx_chan(), tc956x_dma_init_tx_chan(),
>      tc956x_desc_set_addr(), and tc956x_desc_set_sec_addr().
>    - tc956x_mac_disable() is now called if stmmac_dvr_probe() fails;
>      suggested by Sashiko.
>    - Sashiko noted the MDIO device tree node was being leaked.  This
>      has been resolved.
>    - Sashiko also pointed out that IRQ mappings were not being freed,
>      and this too is fixed.
> 
> PATCH 11/12
>    - The reset and clock functions are no longer defined inline
>    - The REFCLK clock name has been renamed REFCLKO, and a comment
>      has been added to explain it is an (unused) output clock.
>    - If the PCI device has no DT node it is reported with dev_err().
>    - <linux/bitfield.h> is now included, to avoid errors in various
>      non-Arm64 builds.
>    - The devicetree Ethernet node is no longer leaked in adev_device_add()
>      (noticed by Sashiko).
>    - The Kconfig entry now depends on ARM64 or COMPILE_TEST
>    - The Kconfig entry now selects REGMAP and REGMAP_MMIO
>    - Sashiko reported that the reference count on the PCIe slot
>      for function 0 was being leaked.  This has been fixed.
>    - Sashiko questioned whether the cleanup action to delete
>      a created device link was associated with the wrong device.
>      It was, and this has been fixed.
>    - Sashiko also suggested that the allocated PCI IRQ vector
>      was not properly getting removed.  It now is.
>    - Sashiko suggested that function 1 might proceed with probing
>      even though there was still a chance that function 0's probe
>      failed.  The platform_data pointer that function 1 uses to
>      decide it's OK to probe is now assigned later.
> 
> PATCH 12/12
>    - The PHY interrupt is now defined as a level interrupt.
>    - A typo in the PHY name has been corrected in the patch description
>
