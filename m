netdevsim: reject cls_bpf programs bound to another device

This adds a check to nsim_bpf_setup_tc_block_cb(). The check rejects a
device-bound cls_bpf program whose offload device does not match the
target netdev, and returns -EINVAL with an extack message. The commit
message says this closes a shared-block late-join replay path through
cls_bpf_reoffload().

[Severity: Low]

Can this replay path be reached on the tree this patch applies to? The
commit message says:

  The core cls_bpf attach path rejects a mismatching program, but a
  netdev that joins a shared block later is replayed the stored filter by
  cls_bpf_reoffload() before it is inserted into block->ports, so the
  attach-time check cannot see it.

In net/sched/cls_bpf.c, cls_bpf_prog_from_efd() does this attach check:

	dev = block->q ? qdisc_dev(block->q) : NULL;
	if (!dev || !bpf_offload_dev_match(fp, dev)) {
		NL_SET_ERR_MSG(extack,
			       "Program is bound to a different device");

In net/sched/cls_api.c, tcf_block_create() never sets block->q for a
shared block:

	/* Don't store q pointer for blocks which are shared */
	if (!tcf_block_shared(block))
		block->q = q;

So it looks like every dev-bound program on a shared block is rejected
at attach time. Wouldn't step 3 of the reproducer ("install the program
on a shared block owned by B") fail with "Program is bound to a
different device"?

If so, cls_bpf_reoffload() never holds a dev-bound filter on a shared
block that it could replay to a joining device. A non-shared block has
only one netdev, and that netdev already passed the attach check.

The late-join path seems to open only with the companion patch
"net/sched: cls_bpf: accept dev-bound programs on shared blocks". That
patch replaces the block->q check with the every-member predicate
mentioned in the v1 -> v2 notes. This comment only becomes accurate once
that patch is applied.

Could the commit message and this comment say that the cls_bpf patch
opens the replay path? Or could they describe the path that the Fixes:
and Cc: stable tags actually cover on older trees, which is direct
attach before 120977e2c096? The code change itself looks fine.

[Severity: Medium]

This is a pre-existing issue that this patch did not introduce, but the
new -EINVAL return adds another way to reach it. The companion cls_bpf
patch lets a dev-bound program sit on a shared block. After that, what
happens to the offload counters when this rejection triggers a rollback?

Say device B holds a skip_sw cls_bpf filter with a B-bound program on a
shared block. So in_hw_count == 1, TCA_CLS_FLAGS_IN_HW is set, and
block->offloadcnt == 1. Then netdevsim device C, which has a different
bpf_offload_dev, binds the block:

tcf_block_bind()
  tcf_block_playback_offloads(add=true)
    cls_bpf_reoffload()
      tc_setup_cb_reoffload()
        nsim_bpf_setup_tc_block_cb()   <- returns -EINVAL here

The filter is skip_sw, so the error propagates and
tcf_block_playback_offloads() jumps to err_playback_remove. That replays
add=false over every filter, including the one whose add just failed.

With prog == NULL the new guard is skipped. ns->bpf_offloaded is NULL,
so it is != oldprog, and C's callback takes this path:

	if (ns->bpf_offloaded != oldprog) {
		oldprog = NULL;
		if (!cls_bpf->prog)
			return 0;

tc_setup_cb_reoffload() treats that 0 as a successful removal and calls
tc_cls_offload_cnt_update(..., 1, false):

	*cnt -= diff;
	if (!*cnt)
		tcf_block_offload_dec(block, flags);

Wouldn't in_hw_count then drop from 1 to 0, clearing IN_HW and
decrementing block->offloadcnt, while B still has the program offloaded?
Each later failed join would decrement the u32 in_hw_count again and
wrap it.

Once block->offloadcnt reads 0, tcf_block_offload_in_use() returns
false. Could a device without ndo_setup_tc then bind a block that still
carries a skip_sw filter?

The same imbalance looks reachable on the baseline through netdevsim's
existing rejections, which only apply to adds. One case is an unbound
skip_sw program that B accepts (bpf_tc_non_bound_accept=1) but a joining
C rejects with the default bpf_tc_non_bound_accept=0. Another is the
-EBUSY "driver and netdev offload states mismatch" path.

The root cause seems to have two parts. The core rolls back without
tracking which callbacks accepted the add. Also, netdevsim returns 0 when
asked to remove a program it does not hold.
