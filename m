Yes I wanted to do that and noted it on my todo list yesterday when
noticing the ongoing discussion. Just been super busy with yesterday's
by-yearly release ;-) But at least I wanted to share quick feedback in
this thread about existing uses.

I totally agree, that's why I want to share some feedback. I remember
years ago when splice() was broken in 2.6.25, there were so few users
that I was the one reporting an API issue to Eric who addressed it
early by lack of users. And I even consider that due to the very few
users, it's even acceptable to slightly change the way to use it if
it can provide extra guarantees (like requiring a capability to access
non-anonymous pages for example). It should not break that many apps,
and as long as they can preserve their essential benefits, I think
most will be OK to adapt.

Absolutely!
