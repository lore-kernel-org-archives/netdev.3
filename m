Indeed the principle of "I trust that this device is what it claims to 
be" should be universal, and that's really the thing we should represent 
here, it's just that most existing buses (especially simpler lower-level 
ones like I2C/SPI/etc.) are unlikely to ever have any kind of mechanism 
to be able to usefully attest that.

DMA is simply the biggest and most prominent attack surface for 
malicious devices, as it gives them the means to attempt to access 
arbitrary addresses; however even a non-DMA-capable device is still 
potentially capable of maliciously doing the "wrong" thing with data 
that a kernel driver explicitly gives it - imagine something pretending 
to be a USB network adapter that's actually clever enough to MITM your 
data at the packet level...

Thanks,
Robin.
