net/rds: hold connection references in lookup, sockets and c_passive

This patch makes rds_conn_lookup() and __rds_conn_create() return
referenced connections. It also makes the rs->rs_conn sendmsg cache and
parent->c_passive own references, and serializes rs_conn and the ToS
ioctls under rs_lock. c_passive becomes an RCU-annotated pointer, and the
rs_lock serialization addresses a syzbot KCSAN report on rs->rs_conn.

Closes: https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=879c1877016972360186

[Severity: Low]

Does the patch really give "a cache that no longer sticks to a quiesced
connection" today? If no destroy trigger can run while the socket exists,
this new branch in rds_sendmsg() does not look reachable for user sockets
in this tree:

    if (conn && rds_destroy_pending(conn)) {
        ...
        rs->rs_conn = NULL;

rds_conn_destroy() is only called from three places:

    rds_ib_destroy_nodev_conns() (module exit)
    rds_tcp_kill_sock(), via rds_tcp_exit_net()
    the loop gather/destroy path

t_unloading is only set at module exit.

The cached conn's netns is sock_net(sk), which sk_alloc() pins. Its
c_trans is either the socket's pinned rs_transport or rds_loop_transport.

Could the commit message say that today the only benefit is the rs_lock
serialization that closes the KCSAN report?

[Severity: Low]

rds_sendmsg() now reads rs_tos without rs_lock:

    conn = rds_conn_create_outgoing(sock_net(sock->sk),
                                    &rs->rs_bound_addr, &daddr,
                                    rs->rs_transport,
                                    READ_ONCE(rs->rs_tos),
                                    ...

Taking rs_lock here does not exclude that lockless reader. Should this
store be WRITE_ONCE(rs->rs_tos, tos) to pair with the READ_ONCE()?

The race needs a concurrent sendmsg (with rs_conn still NULL) and a
SIOCRDSSETTOS on the same socket. KCSAN with
CONFIG_KCSAN_ASSUME_PLAIN_WRITES_ATOMIC=n would report it. The c_tos
re-check under rs_lock stops a wrong ToS from being cached, so only the
annotation is missing.

[Severity: Low]

This isn't a bug, but the existing comment further down in
rds_conn_destroy() still says:

    * can never be quiesced twice.  (With the initial reference the
    * only one, as it is at this point in the series, nothing can
    * reach a second call yet; this is the contract the following
    * patches rely on.)

After this patch, rds_conn_lookup() and __rds_conn_create() hand out
references, and rs->rs_conn and parent->c_passive each own one.
rds_incoming already held one.

Should the "initial reference the only one" wording be updated, since a
conn can now outlive its destroy while other holders keep it?

The "nothing can reach a second call yet" part still seems correct.
rds_ib_destroy_nodev_conns() marks swept nodes i_ib_node_detached and
unlinks them before it calls rds_conn_destroy().

[Severity: Low]

Does the c_passive handling read the flag directly? All three c_passive
checks in __rds_conn_create() go through rds_destroy_pending():

    conn = rcu_dereference(parent->c_passive);
    if (conn && rds_destroy_pending(conn))
        conn = NULL;
    ...
    if (rds_destroy_pending(parent)) {
    ...
    if (rds_destroy_pending(passive)) {

rds_destroy_pending() also returns true for !check_net() and for
t_unloading, which this comment says do not matter there.

The new comment in rds_conn_destroy() makes the same claim: "refuses to
install a new one once c_destroy_in_prog is set, which it checks under
this lock".

There is a second mismatch. The comment on the locked branch in
__rds_conn_create() describes a state that does not seem possible:

    if (rds_destroy_pending(passive)) {
        /* Its destroy will clear the parent's
         * pointer under this lock shortly; until
         * then there is no usable passive conn.
         */

rds_conn_destroy() sets c_destroy_in_prog and clears parent->c_passive in
the same rds_conn_lock critical section. So, under that lock, a passive
still stored in parent->c_passive never has c_destroy_in_prog set.

Is rds_destroy_pending(passive) only ever true here because of netns
teardown or unload? If so, the rds_destroy_pending(parent) check just
above would already have caught those cases.

Could the comments or the checks be changed so the two agree?

[Severity: Low]

This isn't a bug, but rs_tos is not above rs_lock. It is the last member
of struct rds_sock, after rs_zcookie_queue.

Also, rds_sendmsg() reads rs_tos without rs_lock, via
READ_ONCE(rs->rs_tos), when it calls rds_conn_create_outgoing(). Could
the comment mention that exception?

[Severity: Medium]

This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but the test is being
rewritten here anyway. Should the cache hit also compare conn->c_dev_if
against scope_id?

Take a socket bound to a non-link-local IPv6 address, so
rs_bound_scope_id == 0. The earlier scope check in rds_sendmsg() then
allows explicit sends with any nonzero sin6_scope_id:

    if (scope_id != rs->rs_bound_scope_id) {
        if (!scope_id) {
            scope_id = rs->rs_bound_scope_id;
        } else if (rs->rs_bound_scope_id) {

A send to fe80::1%A creates and caches a conn with c_dev_if = A.

A later send to fe80::1%B matches here on c_faddr and c_tos alone and
reuses that conn. This skips rds_conn_lookup(), which does key on
c_dev_if.

The transport then uses conn->c_dev_if as the destination scope, for
example in rds_tcp_conn_path_connect():

    sin6.sin6_scope_id = conn->c_dev_if;

Could the message meant for the peer on link B then be delivered to a
different host at fe80::1 on link A?

Adding conn->c_dev_if == scope_id to this test should avoid that. The
baseline predicate had the same gap.
