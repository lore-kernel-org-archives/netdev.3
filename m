net: lapb: fix uninitialized stack frame fields in lapb_decode()

lapb_decode() fills in a caller-allocated struct lapb_frame that lives on
the stack of lapb_data_input().  The patch adds a memset() of that struct at
the top of lapb_decode() and converts the address-byte comparisons into an
if/else-if chain that returns -1 when the address byte matches none of the
expected values.

No Link: tags in the commit header.

A few questions about the commit message and the behavioural change below.

[Severity: Medium]
Is justification 2 accurate?  In the LAPB_EXTENDED branch of lapb_decode()
the U-frame arm already assigns control[1] explicitly, and that line is not
touched by this patch:

	} else if ((skb->data[0] & LAPB_U) == 3) {
		/*
		 * U frame - take out PF
		 */
		frame->type       = skb->data[0] & ~LAPB_SPF;
		frame->pf         = skb->data[0] & LAPB_SPF;
		frame->control[0] = skb->data[0];
		frame->control[1] = 0x00;

The I and S arms in the same branch both assign control[1] = skb->data[1].

For the "illegal frame in LAPB_EXTENDED mode" half of the claim: with
LAPB_S == 0x01 and LAPB_U == 0x03, the three tests

	if (!(skb->data[0] & LAPB_S))
	else if ((skb->data[0] & LAPB_U) == 1)
	else if ((skb->data[0] & LAPB_U) == 3)

cover all 256 control-byte values, since bit 0 clear selects the I arm and
bit 0 set forces skb->data[0] & 3 to be 1 or 3.  Is there any extended-mode
path that returns 0 without writing control[1]?

The only branch that leaves control[1] unwritten is the standard
(non-extended) branch, which the commit message does not mention, and
lapb_transmit_frmr() emits control[1] only in its LAPB_EXTENDED arm:

	if (lapb->mode & LAPB_EXTENDED) {
		...
		*dptr++ = lapb->frmr_data.control[1];
	} else {
		dptr    = skb_put(skb, 4);
		*dptr++ = LAPB_FRMR;
		*dptr++ = lapb->frmr_data.control[0];

Since lapb->mode does not change between decode and FRMR transmission, can
the standard-mode control[1] byte reach the wire either?

Justification 1 does look real: frame->cr was left uninitialized when the
address byte matched neither expected value, and it is encoded into the
transmitted FRMR by

	if (lapb->frmr_data.cr == LAPB_RESPONSE)
		*dptr |= 0x01;

Could the message be narrowed to that one leak?  The Fixes: 1da177e4c3f4
tag means this goes to every stable tree, and the current text makes the
issue look broader than it is.

[Severity: Medium]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but the memset() sits right on
top of a producer/consumer mismatch worth noting.  lapb_decode() advertises
an illegal-frame result via frame->type = LAPB_ILLEGAL, yet no successful
return can leave that value in place: LAPB_ILLEGAL is 0x100, while the
classification arms assign LAPB_I (0), skb->data[0] & 0x0F (0-15) or
skb->data[0] & ~LAPB_SPF (0-255), and as noted above the arms are exhaustive
over the control byte.

The consumer side in lapb_state3_machine() therefore never runs:

	case LAPB_ILLEGAL:
		lapb_dbg(1, "(%p) S3 RX ILLEGAL(%d)\n", lapb->dev, frame->pf);
		lapb->frmr_data = *frame;
		lapb->frmr_type = LAPB_FRMR_W;
		lapb_transmit_frmr(lapb);

There is no default: arm in that switch, so an extended-mode S frame with
skb->data[0] & 0x0F == 0x0D matches no case and is simply dropped at
if (!queued) kfree_skb(skb), rather than producing the FRMR(W) response.

One note specific to the new line: LAPB_I is 0x00, so the memset() must
always be followed by the explicit frame->type = LAPB_ILLEGAL assignment.
If that assignment were ever dropped or reordered, an undecodable frame
would reach the state machines looking like a valid I frame.  Would a
comment there help?

[Severity: Medium]
Should the new early returns be a separate patch?  They change what the
receive path accepts, which is independent of the uninitialized-memory fix.

Before this patch an unexpected address byte only failed to set frame->cr;
decoding continued through skb_pull(skb, 1) into the control-field parser
and the frame still reached the state machine, so a SABM/UA/DISC carrying a
non-conforming address could still drive connection setup and teardown.

After this patch the sole caller drops the frame outright:

net/lapb/lapb_in.c:lapb_data_input() {
	if (lapb_decode(lapb, skb, &frame) < 0) {
		kfree_skb(skb);
		return;
	}

No state machine is entered, no UA/DM/FRMR reply is generated, nothing is
logged, and the trailing lapb_kick(lapb) is skipped.  On a link whose peer
address byte does not match the local MLP/SLP plus DCE/DTE configuration,
the link can no longer leave LAPB_STATE_0, and there is no counter or
message to diagnose it.

Is the early return needed for the leak itself?  With the memset() in place
frame->cr is 0, which is neither LAPB_COMMAND (1) nor LAPB_RESPONSE (2), and
those are the only values ever tested, in lapb_transmit_frmr():

	if (lapb->frmr_data.cr == LAPB_RESPONSE)
		*dptr |= 0x10;

and in lapb_check_need_response():

	if (type == LAPB_COMMAND && pf)
		lapb_enquiry_response(lapb);

Dropping invalid-address frames does match ISO 7776, so the change looks
desirable on its own, but the commit message describes only the mechanical
change ("return -1 when skb->data[0] is not a valid LAPB address byte") and
not the protocol consequence.  Could this be split into zero-initializing
the frame and rejecting invalid address bytes, or at least have the
behavioural effect spelled out for backporters?

>  		} else {
>  			if (skb->data[0] == LAPB_ADDR_C)

> +			else if (skb->data[0] == LAPB_ADDR_D)
>  				frame->cr = LAPB_RESPONSE;
> +			else

>  		}

[ ... remaining address-byte arms are the same change ... ]
