net: stmmac: rework stmmac_rx to support XDP rx multi-buff

This reworks stmmac_rx() so all descriptors of a frame are collected into
an xdp_buff before the XDP program runs. The skb is then built from that
xdp_buff with napi_build_skb() and xdp_update_skb_frags_info(). The
in-progress xdp_buff is kept in rx_q->state across NAPI polls,
NETDEV_XDP_ACT_RX_SG is advertised, XDP metadata is carried into the skb,
and the FCS is stripped by a new stmmac_xdp_shrink_tail() helper.

> For those multi-descriptor frames the old code was buggy as well: it ran
> the XDP program once per descriptor buffer, so for a multi-descriptor
> frame the program was also invoked on continuation buffers holding
> mid-frame payload. It also subtracted ETH_FCS_LEN from the first buffer
> even when it was not the last descriptor (its second buffer empty),
> dropping four bytes from the middle of the frame while marking the FCS as
> already stripped and skipping the final pskb_trim(). Accumulating the
> whole frame before running XDP fixes both.

[Severity: Medium]
The paragraph above describes two existing RX bugs in stmmac_rx():

- the XDP program runs once per descriptor buffer.
- ETH_FCS_LEN is subtracted from buffer1 of a non-last descriptor
  whenever stmmac_xdp_is_enabled(priv) && !buf2_len.

The old path also lost XDP metadata on XDP_PASS.
xdp_prepare_buff() was called with meta_valid=true, but
skb_metadata_set() was never called.

The FCS strip logic came from 88095728511e ("net: stmmac: fix rx
Scatter-Gather support"). That commit carries Fixes: 88ebe2cf7f3f, so it
is headed for stable. The per-descriptor XDP invocation goes back to
5fabb01207a2 and be8b38a722e6 from 2021.

GMAC4 sets GMAC_CONFIG_JE unconditionally. So even at MTU 1500 with XDP
loaded, a remote peer can send a frame that spans several descriptors.
The mid-frame FCS strip additionally needs stmmac_rx_check_buf2_cap() to
be false, which is the case on legacy cores.

Here these fixes are only side effects of a patch that also adds
NETDEV_XDP_ACT_RX_SG and multi-buffer support. The only trailer is
Signed-off-by. The first patch in this series ("net: stmmac: take
ownership of saved RX state at poll entry") does carry Fixes: tags.

Could the fixes go in a separate patch with Fixes: tags, so they can be
picked up for net and stable? As it stands, stable trees that take
88095728511e will keep the per-descriptor XDP run, the mid-frame FCS
strip and the dropped metadata.

[Severity: High]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch. The commit message calls
this work groundwork for XDP on frames that span several descriptors,
though, and the AF_XDP zero-copy receive path still mishandles such
frames. stmmac_rx_zc() releases every non-last descriptor of a frame
without adding its length to len:

drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/stmmac_main.c:stmmac_rx_zc() {
    ...
	/* XSK pool expects RX frame 1:1 mapped to XSK buffer */
	if (likely(status & rx_not_ls)) {
		xsk_buff_free(buf->xdp);
		buf->xdp = NULL;
		dirty++;
		count++;
		goto read_again;
	}
    ...
	buf1_len = stmmac_rx_buf1_len(priv, p, status, len);
    ...
}

When the last descriptor arrives, len is still 0, or whatever was
saved at the previous poll boundary. stmmac_rx_buf1_len() therefore
computes min(dma_buf_sz, plen - len) from the full frame length, not
from the bytes left for this descriptor. For a frame longer than
dma_buf_sz that gives dma_buf_sz. The DMA only wrote the last
plen - (n - 1) * dma_buf_sz bytes into this XSK buffer.

buf->xdp->data_end is then set from that value. The XDP program, an
AF_XDP socket on XDP_REDIRECT, and stmmac_construct_skb_zc() on
XDP_PASS all receive the tail of the frame plus whatever was left in
the UMEM chunk, presented as a complete packet. The head of the frame
is silently lost, and none of this is counted in rx_dropped.

As noted above, GMAC4 sets GMAC_CONFIG_JE unconditionally. A remote
peer can therefore already send such frames while an XSK pool is
bound, whatever the MTU check in stmmac_xdp_set_prog() allows.

Fixing only the len accounting would still hand userspace the tail of
the frame as if it were a whole packet. Should stmmac_rx_zc() instead
mark the frame as errored on the first rx_not_ls descriptor? The last
descriptor would then be released too, and the whole frame accounted
as dropped.

[Severity: Medium]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but the AF_XDP zero-copy
XDP_PASS path still loses the metadata contents.
stmmac_construct_skb_zc() copies only the packet bytes into the new skb:

drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/stmmac_main.c:stmmac_construct_skb_zc() {
    ...
	skb_reserve(skb, xdp->data - xdp->data_hard_start);
	memcpy(__skb_put(skb, datasize), xdp->data, datasize);
	if (metasize)
		skb_metadata_set(skb, metasize);
    ...
}

skb_metadata_set() only records meta_len. The bytes in
[xdp->data_meta, xdp->data) are never copied.

Take a program that calls bpf_xdp_adjust_meta() and returns XDP_PASS,
on the path stmmac_rx_zc()->stmmac_dispatch_skb_zc()->
stmmac_construct_skb_zc(). Would a TC/BPF program then read
uninitialized skb headroom through data_meta?

Other drivers such as i40e copy from xdp->data_meta instead. The commit
message says metadata is now carried into the skb. Should the ZC path
get the same treatment?

[Severity: Medium]
This is a pre-existing issue, but is a DMA read barrier missing between
the ownership check and the reads of the other descriptor words?
dwmac4_wrback_get_rx_status() loads des1 and des2 before it checks
RDES3_OWN:

drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/dwmac4_descs.c:dwmac4_wrback_get_rx_status() {
	u32 rdes1 = le32_to_cpu(p->des1);
	u32 rdes2 = le32_to_cpu(p->des2);
	u32 rdes3 = le32_to_cpu(p->des3);
    ...
	if (unlikely(rdes3 & RDES3_OWN))
		return dma_own;
    ...
}

stmmac_rx() has no dma_rmb() after its dma_own check either. On weakly
ordered CPUs such as arm64, could des1/des2 be read before the DMA
writeback and des3 after it?

If so, a stale rdes1 could be missing RDES1_IP_PAYLOAD_ERROR or
RDES1_IP_HDR_ERROR, and a frame with a bad checksum would be marked
CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY. Stale rdes2 bits could also cause spurious
filter-fail drops.

[Severity: Low]
This frees buf->sec_page for every descriptor seen while error is set.
On GMAC4, dwmac4_wrback_get_rx_status() returns discard_frame for RX
timestamp context descriptors:

	if (unlikely(rdes3 & RDES3_CONTEXT_DESCRIPTOR))
		return discard_frame;

The DMA writes only descriptor words for those slots, so their pages are
still valid. With hwts_rx_en, every timestamped frame is followed by such
a slot.

Before this patch, discard_frame released only buf->page and sec_page
stayed attached. Continuation descriptors of an errored frame also kept
their pages.

Is it intended that each context slot now hands two DMA-mapped pages
back to the page_pool? stmmac_rx_refill() then has to allocate a new
sec_page with GFP_ATOMIC for each one. It stops at the first allocation
failure, so this adds one more way for ring re-arming to stall under
memory pressure.

[Severity: Medium]
stmmac_build_skb() now calls skb_metadata_set(skb, metasize). That
assumes the metadata sits directly before the MAC header, because
skb_metadata_end() returns skb_mac_header(skb).

When hw_vlan_en is false, stmmac_rx_vlan() pops the tag by moving the
MAC addresses forward. This happens on dwmac100/dwmac1000 cores with
NETIF_F_HW_VLAN_CTAG_RX set, for example:

drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/stmmac_main.c:stmmac_rx_vlan() {
    ...
		memmove(skb->data + VLAN_HLEN, veth, ETH_ALEN * 2);
		skb_pull(skb, VLAN_HLEN);
    ...
}

The metadata stays where it is, and eth_type_trans() then sets the MAC
header VLAN_HLEN bytes further in. For VLAN-tagged frames, would TC/BPF
programs reading data_meta lose the first 4 metadata bytes and see 4
bytes of the original destination MAC in their place?

The core helper skb_reorder_vlan_header() moves the metadata along with
the header:

net/core/skbuff.c:skb_reorder_vlan_header() {
    ...
	meta_len = skb_metadata_len(skb);
	if (meta_len) {
		meta = skb_metadata_end(skb) - meta_len;
		memmove(meta + VLAN_HLEN, meta, meta_len);
	}
    ...
}

Before this patch the metadata was dropped (meta_len 0) rather than
misaligned.
