net/rds: free every path's transport data on the passive create paths

This moves the per-path cp_transport_data free loop from the
lost-creation-race exit of __rds_conn_create() into a new helper,
rds_conn_free_transport_data(), and calls that helper from the
passive-connection exit as well as the race exit.

[Severity: High]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but while looking at the
create-side npaths handling that this helper generalizes, the teardown side
looks asymmetric for the same reason.

__rds_conn_create() computes npaths from the caller's transport, before
trans can be swapped:

	int npaths = (trans->t_mp_capable ? RDS_MPATH_WORKERS : 1);
	...
		if (trans->t_prefer_loopback) {
			if (likely(is_outgoing)) {
				trans = &rds_loop_transport;
	...
	conn->c_trans = trans;

	for (i = 0; i < npaths; i++) {
		...
		conn->c_path[i].cp_wq =
			alloc_ordered_workqueue("krds_cp_wq#%d/%d", 0, seq, i);

So a conn created with trans == rds_tcp_transport (t_mp_capable, npaths ==
RDS_MPATH_WORKERS) but whose c_trans ends up as rds_loop_transport has a
workqueue on every one of the 8 paths.

rds_conn_destroy() then recomputes the bound from the stored transport:

	int npaths = (conn->c_trans->t_mp_capable ? RDS_MPATH_WORKERS : 1);

which is 1 for rds_loop_transport, so c_path[1..7] are never passed to
rds_conn_path_destroy() before kfree(conn->c_path).  Does this leak the
ordered workqueues allocated for paths 1..7 on every loopback connection
teardown, for example when rds_loop_kill_conns() runs on netns exit?

There also looks to be a second obstacle even if the destroy bound were
widened, since rds_conn_path_destroy() returns before it reaches the
workqueue release:

	static void rds_conn_path_destroy(struct rds_conn_path *cp)
	{
		struct rds_message *rm, *rtmp;

		if (!cp->cp_transport_data)
			return;
	...
		if (cp->cp_wq != rds_wq)
			destroy_workqueue(cp->cp_wq);

rds_loop_conn_alloc() only sets c_path[0].cp_transport_data (through the
c_transport_data macro), so paths 1..7 hold a workqueue and no transport
data.  Should that early return move below the cp_wq teardown?

The same pattern appears later in the series, in rds_conn_destroy_fini()
and rds_conn_path_free() at 9157f3187071.

[Severity: Medium]
Can npaths ever be greater than 1 at this exit?

The commit message says:

    The passive-connection exit right above it, taken when a loopback
    parent already has its c_passive twin, frees only path 0 and leaks
    the transport data of paths 1..npaths-1.  RDS/TCP loopback is
    exactly a multipath passive connection, so this is reachable.

npaths comes only from the caller's transport:

	int npaths = (trans->t_mp_capable ? RDS_MPATH_WORKERS : 1);

and t_mp_capable = 1 is set only by rds_tcp_transport in net/rds/tcp.c.

parent is set only here:

	conn = rds_conn_lookup(net, head, laddr, faddr, trans, tos, dev_if);
	if (conn &&
	    conn->c_loopback &&
	    conn->c_trans != &rds_loop_transport &&
	    ipv6_addr_equal(laddr, faddr) &&
	    !is_outgoing) {
		parent = conn;

rds_conn_lookup() additionally requires conn->c_trans == trans, so the
parent's transport is the same transport that produced npaths.

c_loopback = 1 is assigned in exactly one place, and since
rds_tcp_transport sets t_prefer_loopback = 1 that block either swaps trans
for &rds_loop_transport (is_outgoing), which the parent test excludes and
which a lookup with trans == tcp cannot match, or bails out with
-EOPNOTSUPP (!is_outgoing) before any conn is installed:

		conn->c_loopback = 1;
		if (trans->t_prefer_loopback) {
			if (likely(is_outgoing)) {
				trans = &rds_loop_transport;
			} else {
				...
				conn = ERR_PTR(-EOPNOTSUPP);

That seems to leave only a non-prefer-loopback transport (IB, which does not
set t_mp_capable) able to reach the parent branch, i.e. npaths == 1, where
the previous single free of c_path[0].cp_transport_data already covered
everything.

The in-tree incoming TCP path also rejects a local peer before
rds_conn_create() is reached:

	net/rds/tcp_listen.c:rds_tcp_accept_one() {
		if (!rds_tcp_laddr_check(sock_net(listen_sock->sk), peer_addr, dev_if)) {
			/* local address connection is only allowed via loopback */
			ret = -EOPNOTSUPP;

If that analysis holds, the new loop is a no-op on the reachable passive
path.  Should the changelog and the Fixes: 1c5113cf796b tag be adjusted so
this is described as consolidation rather than a memory leak fix, to avoid
an unnecessary stable backport?
