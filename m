selftests: drv-net: test AF_XDP zero-copy with an SKB peer

This adds drivers/net/hw/xsk.py. It runs the xskxceiver cases as pairs of
endpoints: zero-copy on the DUT and SKB mode on the remote host. Once per
run, main() takes the last DUT queue out of RSS, adds ntuple rules on both
hosts and reserves huge pages. Each case sizes the rings for the HW_SW ring
size cases and registers XDP and MTU fallbacks, which are cancelled when
both endpoints pass or skip.

[Severity: Low]
Do these ring requirements match what the C side checks? In test_xsk.c,
testapp_hw_sw_min_ring_size() and testapp_hw_sw_max_ring_size() both skip
unless the tx ifobj has XSK_CAP_HW_RING:

tools/testing/selftests/net/lib/xsk/test_xsk.c:testapp_hw_sw_min_ring_size() {
    ...
	if (!ifobj_has_cap(test->ifobj_tx, XSK_CAP_HW_RING)) {
		ksft_print_msg("HW ring sizes not supported.\n");
    ...
}

On the receiving endpoint, ifobj_tx is the peer shadow. setup_peer() in
xskxceiver.c fills it with the local caps:

	shadow->caps = local->caps;

So the receiver ends up checking whether its own NIC can report ring
sizes.

In tx_HW_SW_MIN_RING_SIZE the remote is the SKB-mode receiver. If the
remote NIC has no get_ringparam, the remote endpoint skips and tells the
DUT to skip too. The case is then reported as skipped, even though xsk.py
never needs the remote ring and has already resized the DUT TX ring.

testapp_hw_sw_max_ring_size() has a similar issue:

	batch_size = min(xsk_get_cap(test, tx_max_pending), max_descs) - 8;

xsk_get_cap() reads test->ifobj_tx->caps, so each host takes
tx_max_pending from its own NIC. If the two NICs have different TX
maximums, can the two endpoints end up using different batch sizes?

[Severity: Medium]
Does the indirection table set here stay in place for the rest of the run
on every zero-copy driver? ixgbe advertises xsk-zerocopy, but
ixgbe_setup_reta() rebuilds the table on every configure. It never checks
netif_is_rxfh_configured():

drivers/net/ethernet/intel/ixgbe/ixgbe_main.c:ixgbe_setup_reta() {
    ...
	/* Fill out redirection table */
	memset(adapter->rss_indir_tbl, 0, sizeof(adapter->rss_indir_tbl));
    ...
}

The first rebuild happens right after _reserve_queue(), when _steer_udp()
turns ntuple-filters on:

_steer_udp() "ethtool -K <if> ntuple-filters on"
  ixgbe_set_features()     (need_reset)
    ixgbe_do_reset()
      ixgbe_up()
        ixgbe_configure()
          ixgbe_configure_rx()
            ixgbe_setup_mrqc()
              ixgbe_setup_reta()

It also happens inside every case. xskxceiver's driver-mode XDP attach and
detach go through ixgbe_xdp_setup(), which closes and reopens the device:

	err = ixgbe_setup_tc(dev, adapter->hw_tcs);

MTU and ring changes reinit the device as well.

ixgbe_fdir_filter_restore() puts the ntuple rule back, but it does not
restore the RETA, so the reserved queue gets RSS traffic again. In TX
cases the zero-copy socket on that queue fills no RX buffers. Anything
hashed to that queue is dropped, including the TCP control connection on
the random ctrl_port.

Would this show up as intermittent timeouts on ixgbe DUTs rather than as
a skip? The runner never reads the table back with rss_get to detect it.

[Severity: Low]
Does a 0 or skip exit code actually show that the XDP programs were
detached? cleanup_iface() in xskxceiver.c does not check the result of
the detach:

	if (ifobj->xdp_prog)
		xsk_detach_xdp_program(ifobj->ifindex,
				       mode_to_xdp_flags(ifobj->mode));

xsk_detach_xdp_program() in xsk.c also throws away the return value of
bpf_xdp_detach():

void xsk_detach_xdp_program(int ifindex, u32 xdp_flags)
{
	bpf_xdp_detach(ifindex, xdp_flags, NULL);
}

Only an MTU restore error changes the endpoint's exit code.

Suppose bpf_xdp_detach() fails, for example because the driver's ndo_bpf
rejects the reconfiguration. The endpoint still exits 0, and this loop
also cancels the "xdpdrv off" and "xdpgeneric off" fallbacks. After the
last case, the program and its XSKMAP would stay attached to the
interface.

Running "xdpdrv off" when no program is attached does nothing. Could the
XDP fallbacks be kept, and only the MTU fallbacks be cancelled?
