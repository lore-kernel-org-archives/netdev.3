We're aware of the power control driver and its use of these GPIOs.

I think the point you're making is not about the specific way we
are using GPIOs, but that someone could try to use this GPIO
controller in a way that would lead to a circular dependency
(between the controller and the PCIe device it depends on).

And you suggest a GPIO driver that uses I2C (and would be
used by the pwrctrl driver as well), and I think it's a pretty
reasonable suggestion.

Yes, on the RB3gen2 platform, reset signals (PERST#) for two of
the TC9563 PCIe switch ports (downstream 1 and downstream 2) are
managed by the GPIO controller that resides within the TC9563
itself.  The pwrctl driver takes special care to ensure the GPIO
controller is functional (powered) before trying to use it.

The TC9563 *chip* gets powered when its embedded PCIe switch is
probed--that is, when its upstream port begins its enumeration.
(It's a little unclear to me which of the supplies are required
for the various non-PCIe components on the chip, including I2C
and GPIO, to be functional.)

And so until the switch gets probed (and its pwrctl driver used),
the GPIO controller can't work.  So nothing internal to the TC956x 
should be dependent on any of the GPIOs supplied by this controller.
(Except the pwrctrl driver, which enables power before using GPIO.)


Two things to note:
- We are working with TC9564 (and there are other successors in
   the TC956x series).
- Downstream port 3 (which we are using) on the switch does not
   have such a distinct controlled reset line.

The way I understood it was that certain parameters for the PCIe
links needed to be set before using them, and the pwrctrl framework
made that possible.  (I summarize what that driver does at the end
of this message.)

This part I didn't know before.  Yes, the bridge windows are
allocated by Linux rather than by firmware.  And if this host
bridge doesn't support hotplug, then yes, to correctly assign
address space, all PCIe devices must be available to report
their required memory space.

Are you saying that "setting those parameters" wouldn't be
needed if this particular root port supported hotplug?  (I'm
just curious; it's not relevant to the point you're making.)

The only GPIOs we're using are for asserting reset on the two
Ethernet PHYs.  That doesn't occur until after the embedded
endpoint functions are probed, so this should be OK.

However you're right, the lines on this GPIO controller should
be restricted to avoid this circular dependency.

Daniel and I have talked about this solution exactly, but opted
not to propose using it just yet (not unless someone like you
suggested it...).  Our solution for now was just to have the
(PCIe BAR-based) GPIO driver reserve the two GPIO lines used by
the pwrctrl driver, and rely on the fact that the pwrctrl driver
will only touch those shared registers at times the "real" GPIO
driver does not.


We could instead implement a "proper" I2C-based GPIO controller
driver.  This would be used by the pwrctrl driver (rather than
that driver just updating the registers directly), as well as
the Ethernet PHY for reset control, and for any other uses on
future platforms.

All uses so far are for managing resets, so the higher I2C
latency wouldn't be much of an issue.

One thing I'll point out is that the next version of this
code will define "pci-ep-bus" nodes, and will not use the
auxiliary bus model.  However the issue you raise remains
in that model too.

Thank you very much for raising this Mani.  Please see my
questions a little further below.

Here's what the pwrctrl driver does:

In drivers/pci/pwrctrl/pci-pwrctrl-tc9563.c, the registers at
offset 0x1208 and 0x1210 from the base of the "SFR" address space
are updated to assert/deassert these two reset signals.  It does
so using the I2C interface--out of band from access via PCI BARs.
The reset signals are GPIO02 (for downstream endpoint 1 on the
switch) and GPIO03 (for endpoint 2), which are controlled by
bits 2 and 3 in the two registers, respectively.

The pwrctrl driver enables a set of regulators defined in the
devicetree node for the upstream port of the TC9564 embedded
PCIe switch.  It then asserts the main RESX (chip) reset signal,
and after a short delay asserts these other two resets.

At that point it uses properties defined in devicetree to
configure five "ports":  upstream, downstream 1-3, and Ethernet.
(I have some questions related to this--but I put them below.)
The properties configured are:  ASPM L0s entry delay; ASP L1 entry
delay; TX amplitude; Number of Fast Training Sequences (NTFS); and 
Decision Feedback Equalization (DFE).

Finally, the two resets and the main RESX reset are deasserted,
and the driver reports that the device is now ready, with:
   devm_pci_pwrctrl_device_set_ready();



Questions related to the "ports" configured by the pwrctrl driver:
- Given that downstream port 3 connects to the internal, embedded
   PCIe endpoint, does it still require these settings programmed?

- Does the TC9563 chip have only *one* function on its embedded
   endpoint, supporting just one Ethernet?
     - If so, this driver will have to be modified to support
       the second embedded function and Ethernet controller.

- Why is "Ethernet" configured like the PCIe ports, *in addition*
   to the downstream port 3 that it sits behind?
