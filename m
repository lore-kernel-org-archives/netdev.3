Subject: [PATCH net-next v2 0/5] net/rds: own the fastpath locks across connection teardown

Hi all,

This is v2 of the follow-up set to "net/rds: Bug fix ports, part 2"
[1] (v1 of this set is at [2]).  During review of part 2, the later
half of that series needed more work than a respin, so it was split
off into this set together with the companion fixes identified along
the way.

RDS connection teardown quiesces the transmit and receive-refill fast
paths by waiting for the RDS_IN_XMIT/RDS_RECV_REFILL bits to be
sampled clear.  Sampling a bit clear is not owning it: the fast path
can re-take its bit right after the wait returns and then run
concurrently with the transport shutdown and the send-state reset.
Oracle UEK closed this by making teardown acquire the bits as locks
("rds: Make sure transmit path and connection tear-down does not run
concurrently"); patches 4 and 5 do the same for the two
rds_send_path_reset() call sites upstream.  These two are effectively
v3 of patches 4 and 3 of "net/rds: Bug fix ports, part 2" [1].

Making teardown block on the bits as locks promotes three latent
ordering bugs from rare to load-bearing, so they are fixed first:

  Patch 1: release_in_xmit() checks waitqueue_active() after
  clear_bit_unlock(), which does not order that read; the wake-up of
  the (now uninterruptible, untimed) teardown wait can be lost.  Use
  wq_has_sleeper().

  Patch 2: rds_conn_path_reset() wipes the whole cp_flags word with a
  plain store.  Once teardown owns bits in that word across the
  reset, a blanket store would end lock ownership early - and it
  already races atomic RMWs on the same word today.  Clear the bits
  the reset is responsible for individually, as Oracle UEK also does.

  Patch 3: rds_tcp_reset_callbacks() stores RDS_CONN_RESETTING
  unconditionally, which can overwrite the RDS_CONN_ERROR or
  RDS_CONN_DISCONNECTING of a shutdown already in progress on the
  same path and send that shutdown through an extra drop cycle.  Once
  the accept path can park for the duration of a teardown (patch 5)
  that window widens, so make the transition conditional first, as
  Oracle UEK does.

With those in place, patch 4 converts rds_tcp_reset_callbacks() from
waiting on RDS_IN_XMIT to acquiring it, holding it across the socket
swap and rds_send_path_reset(), and patch 5 has rds_conn_shutdown()
hold both bit locks across the transport shutdown and path reset.
The order matters: with the accept path owning the lock first, no
intermediate commit leaves it resuming on a socket pointer that a
lock-holding teardown has already released.

[PATCH net-next 1/5] net/rds: use wq_has_sleeper() in release_in_xmit()
  Restore full barrier before wake-up checks in release_in_xmit()

[PATCH net-next 2/5] net/rds: clear cp_flags bits individually in rds_conn_path_reset()
  Partial port of commit d04896037223 ("net/rds: Preserve essential connection state flags")
  https://github.com/oracle/linux-uek/commit/d04896037223

[PATCH net-next 3/5] net/rds: tcp: don't force RDS_CONN_RESETTING over a concurrent shutdown
  Port of commit 72c176a1d9ac ("net/rds: Don't force state RDS_CONN_RESETTING")
  https://github.com/oracle/linux-uek/commit/72c176a1d9ac

[PATCH net-next 4/5] net/rds: acquire RDS_IN_XMIT in rds_tcp_reset_callbacks()
  Extend the port in patch 5 to the second rds_send_path_reset() call site

[PATCH net-next 5/5] net/rds: acquire the fastpath locks in rds_conn_shutdown()
  Port of commit 2b8aaa4f163b ("rds: Make sure transmit path and connection tear-down does not run concurrently")
  https://github.com/oracle/linux-uek/commit/2b8aaa4f163b

Changes since v1 [2]:
  - New patch 3, porting the UEK fix for the accept-vs-shutdown state
    race; the RESETTING store is now a conditional transition.
  - Patches 4 and 5 (formerly 4 and 3) reordered so that
    rds_tcp_reset_callbacks() owns RDS_IN_XMIT before
    rds_conn_shutdown() does; no intermediate commit is a bisect
    hazard.
  - Patch 2 gains a Fixes tag; patch 4 refreshes the stale block
    comment above rds_tcp_reset_callbacks(); patch 5's changelog
    describes the accept-side waiter parking on krdsd for the
    duration of a TCP teardown and why that is preferable to the race.

Questions and comments appreciated!

Thanks,
Allison
