selftests: dpll: add pin priority test

This adds test_pin_priority_get_set() to dpll_features.sh. The test sets a
new priority on a spare input pin, reads it back and restores the original
value. dpllsim_add_pin() gains an optional priority argument, and the
standard and stress simulator devices now set priorities on their input
pins.

[Severity: Low]
Is "the simulator accepts every priority" accurate? The commit message makes
the same claim. However, dpllsim_pin_prio_set() rejects anything above
DPLLSIM_PIN_PRIO_MAX, which is 255 in dpllsim.h:

drivers/dpll/dpllsim/dpll.c:dpllsim_pin_prio_set() {
    ...
	if (prio > DPLLSIM_PIN_PRIO_MAX) {
		NL_SET_ERR_MSG_FMT(extack, "Pin priority must be in range 0-%u",
				   DPLLSIM_PIN_PRIO_MAX);
		return -EINVAL;
	}
    ...
}

The configfs store dpllsim_pin_prio_store() applies the same limit.

The test still works today. Since before is capped at 255, the candidates
(before - 1, 1 and 7) are always in range.

This comment is the reason a refusal on the created device is a failure and
not a skip. Could it say "every priority in 0-255" or "every value tried
here"? The comment is still the same at the end of the series.

[Severity: Medium]
Can this make a user-provided device switch its reference?

The comment above pick_tune_pin() says PIN_TUNE_ID "must not be the
reference the device is locked to". It also says tests skip "rather than
reconfiguring the reference". But pick_tune_pin() accepts selectable pins:

	case "$state" in
	disconnected|selectable)
		;;

In automatic mode, a selectable input takes part in reference selection by
priority. This loop gives that pin a higher priority (a smaller value). It
never compares the new value with the priority of the current reference.

On a device set through DPLL_DEV_ID or DPLL_DRIVER, the new priority reaches
hardware straight away. zl3073x_dpll_input_pin_prio_set() writes REF_PRIO
through zl3073x_chan_state_set() when zl3073x_chan_ref_is_selectable()
holds. ice_dpll_hw_input_prio_set() sends it to the CGU firmware through
ice_aq_set_cgu_ref_prio().

Take a device in automatic, revertive mode with a valid signal on the spare
input. If before - 1 ties the locked reference's priority, or if 1 or 7
beats it, could the DPLL switch to the spare pin? Restoring the priority
could then switch it back. Each switch can disturb outputs feeding SyncE or
PTP.

Would it work to pick a target that does not outrank the connected
reference? Other options are to change the priority only on disconnected
pins, or to skip in automatic mode on user-provided devices.

[Severity: Medium]
What happens here in the case the candidate loop is built for? The commit
message says:

  since a large current value may mark an unused pin outside the settable
  range, as the ice driver does with 255.

In that case before itself cannot be set. Suppose before - 1 (254) is
refused and then 1 or 7 is accepted. The pin's hardware priority has
changed, and this restore to before would be refused for the same reason.

The test would then report a failure, not a skip, on a user-provided
device. The deferred restore sends the same value, so it also fails, and
without any message. The unused input stays at priority 1 or 7 on the
user's hardware, and in automatic mode it could then be picked as a
reference.

ice_dpll_input_prio_set() and ice_dpll_hw_input_prio_set() do no range
check of their own. They pass (u8)prio to firmware, so only firmware
decides whether 255 can be written back.

test_pin_state_transitions() treats a refused restore as a skip when RET is
0, but this test does not. Should it first check that before can be set,
for example by writing it back once, before trying a different value? The
code is still the same at the end of the series.

[Severity: Low]
Is "(active reference)" correct for the simulator? It does not seem to ever
select or lock to a reference.

dpllsim_pin_reset() starts every pin disconnected:

	pin->ops = dpllsim_pin_select_ops(pin);
	pin->state = DPLL_PIN_STATE_DISCONNECTED;

dpllsim_pin_prio_set() only stores sim_pin->prio, and nothing else reads
it. sim->lock_status is set once to DPLL_LOCK_STATUS_UNLOCKED in core.c and
never changes.

The device is always in automatic mode. dpllsim_pin_state_set() accepts
only disconnected and selectable there, so no pin is ever connected.

So gnss0 never becomes the active reference, and its prio 0 does not affect
which pin is used. That includes the tie test_pin_priority_get_set() can
create by setting ext0 to 0. The comment is still the same at the end of
the series, and no later patch adds selection by priority.
