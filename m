Yes. v3 [1] is on net, with nothing under it, and split so that the
lock patch, 5/7, has only the softirq side:

  1/7  msglimit_adv, on its own
  2/7  sendmsg() fails with -EPIPE when sending is shut down under it
  3/7  recvmsg() under lock_sock()
  4/7  code moved for 5/7, no functional change
  5/7  the HiperSockets rx path under the socket lock
  6/7  RCV_SHUTDOWN set under sk_lock.slock
  7/7  EOF for a reader parked when the peer closes (was 2/2)

v3 drops the iucv_send_ctrl() rewrite, the window update only while
connected and the credit reset. With them out, v3 fails five of my 53
default tests, the way net fails them; the cover letter lists them so
nobody reads them as regressions.

> Can you polish the style (comments, commit message) some more?

Every function 4/7 and 5/7 add has a kernel-doc header that says who
holds what (softirq under bh_lock_sock(), or the owner under
sk_lock.slock) and what the function decides; the comments inside are
in net style and short.

Each of the six that fix something says what is seen, under which
conditions and what it costs, and has its Fixes: tag. 4/7 only moves
code.

> Let us know, if you want Hidayath or myself to take on any of this.

One thing, and it's the part I can't do: the run on z/VM. Hidayath's
numbers on v1 [2] are what I calibrated my setup against, and v3 moves
enough code that I'd like the same run on it before the RFC tag goes:
the scenarios at 120 s each with net as the baseline, the blocked reader
and SO_MSGLIMIT in IUCV_BOUND, and the KCSAN build. Here it's QEMU TCG
with an emulated adapter and CP: rates, KCSAN and real SMP only come
from the hardware. The cover letter says what I expect from each
scenario, patch by patch, so a miss is easy to spot.

> what follows is alist of 3(?) problems in current code, may

3/7 lists the three that are recvmsg()'s own. 5/7 has the softirq's
two in its first paragraph, and a list for what happens to each kind of
frame. The window update and the credit are out.

> What are possible consequences? UAF? Can you give 1 example, maybe even
> with KASAN(?) output?

No UAF AFAICT, and no KASAN splat: the KASAN runs here and Hidayath's
are clean on net-next for these paths. What's measured is wrong
behaviour and leaks, not memory corruption. On his guest, 120 s
per scenario on net-next: 3917 reads that go backwards with two readers
on one socket, the sk_shutdown bit lost in 565 of 7281 cycles, data read
after shutdown(SHUT_RD) in 32 of 212, and 29 KCSAN reports with af_iucv
on both sides, 19 of them recvmsg() against shutdown().

The example in the commit message of 5/7 is a listener. A SYN that
arrives while close() is emptying the accept queue is answered under
the closing task, and its child is queued on a socket that is freed a
moment later. Nothing can accept or close that child: it is never
freed, and since it carries the listener's name, the next bind() to
that name fails with -EADDRINUSE. I reproduced it on net with an
mdelay() in iucv_sock_cleanup_listen() to hold the window open, which
is otherwise a few instructions wide; with 5/7 and the same delay the
SYN waits for the close and is refused. KASAN stayed quiet: the child's
pointer to the freed listener is never followed.

The one that comes with kernel output is the third item of 3/7, which I
found while reviewing v3: a MSG_PEEK read that a second reader
overtakes never frees its skb, and iucv_sock_destruct() takes its
WARN_ON() on sk_rmem_alloc when the socket goes. On net main:

  WARNING: net/iucv/af_iucv.c:292 at iucv_sock_destruct+0xb8/0xe0, CPU#1: i=
nit/1
  Call Trace:
   iucv_sock_destruct+0xbc/0xe0
   __sk_destruct+0x5a/0x430
   iucv_sock_release+0xbc/0xd0
   __sock_release+0x74/0x140
   sock_close+0x2a/0x40

It's gone with 3/7.

On its own, close to style: a window update for a peer that has sent
its FIN is a frame nobody uses. It's the IUCV_CONNECTED test you
suggested in July. v2 had it because the credit reset needed it (next
point); v3 leaves that code as net has it. The test is in [3] 2/2,
where you asked whether it can be false the next cycle without the
socket lock. On top of v3 a FIN can no longer change sk_state under
recvmsg() (5/7). afiucv_hs_callback_txnotify() and the netdev notifier
still can; the cover letter lists both as open.

Yes, when iucv_send_ctrl() has no room in sk_sndbuf for the WIN:
recvmsg() sets IUCV_DISCONN and keeps msg_recv. The next frame read is
the peer's SHT, counted one past the window: WARN_ON() and -EFAULT where
EOF was due. And yes, your [1], which is [3] 2/2 below, covers it: with
the SHT not counted, the credit that was kept cannot pass the window. So
the reset is gone from v3. On net without [3] that case still ends in
the WARN_ON(); one of my tests shows it on v3 as on net.

Yes. Nothing resends them, and the socket backlog can refuse an skb
under memory pressure. The commit message and the comment on
afiucv_hs_record() say so now.

1/7. It goes first because the backlog of 5/7 counts against that
window; on the live msglimit it would drop data without a trace, which
is what Hidayath's SO_MSGLIMIT scenario found on v1. On its own it
fixes two things on net, both after SO_MSGLIMIT is changed with the SYN
out: lowered, the socket is closed on a peer that kept to its window
(WARN_ON() and -EFAULT); raised far enough, the peer never gets a
window update.

(the iucv_send_ctrl() rewrite) It isn't related to the lock, and it's
out of v3. I wouldn't put it in [3] 2/2 either: that one is the
receiver not counting an SHT, this is the sender finding no room in
sk_sndbuf for its own FIN or SHT. What v3 keeps from that area is 2/7,
which is sendmsg() only.

Done for everything the series adds.

v3 is on net main (8373c4e8863a) with nothing under it. Of [3], 1/2
applies on top of it as it is; 2/2 needs a rebase, since it touches the
lines 1/7 changes.

(the atomic_set() of msg_recv) No, and it's out; see the credit above.

The two 3/7 adds to recvmsg() are unlock and err_unlock: they release
the socket and return. 5/7 has one more, refuse, in
afiucv_hs_backlog_add(), for a frame that cannot wait. done and err_out
are the file's own; I left them so the diff stays on the locking.

It was wrong. "a reader holding the lock would otherwise wait for its
own window" was the reason in an earlier draft, before recvmsg() slept
without the lock. The kernel-doc on
afiucv_hs_defer() now gives the two cases in which a data, SHT or WIN
frame waits: the reply to our SYN is recorded and not applied yet, so
the socket is still IUCV_BOUND and would free the data; or frames wait
already, and a later one must not overtake them.

Both taken. And yes, that's why: the window is in frames, and
sk_add_backlog() counts bytes, the receive queue's included, so it can
refuse a frame the peer was entitled to send.

> I like the new afiucv_hs_rcv() a lot.

Its shape is the same in v3. The filter at its top changed: the AI
review of v2 [4] found that a FIN reaching a socket still in IUCV_BOUND
was recorded and disconnected it once the SYN|ACK arrived, and that
frames behind a recorded FIN were still taken. Both repro here on v2
and are fixed in 5/7.

Thanks for the review.
