Subject: [PATCH net-next v12 11/12] net/rds: give cm_id->context a reference on its connection

rds_rdma_cm_event_handler_cmn() picks the connection up from
cm_id->context and holds c_cm_lock - a mutex that lives in the
connection's path array - across the transport callbacks, but the
context pointer owns no reference.  What keeps the connection alive
under the handler is ordering: rds_ib_conn_path_shutdown() destroys the
id, and rdma_destroy_id() waits for a running handler, before the
destroy drops the connection's initial reference, so no event is
handled on a connection that is being freed.  Before this series that
ordering was broken from inside the handler, since rds_conn_destroy()
freed synchronously and the one callback that destroyed its
connection, rds_ib_cm_connect_complete() on a protocol version below
3.1, left the handler's mutex_unlock() running on freed memory;
commit f97d8c7bab78 ("rds: ib: use rds_conn_drop() on protocol version
mismatch") has since switched that path to rds_conn_drop(), which also
removed the deadlock that destroy took on c_cm_lock.

Now that connections are reference counted, give the id a reference of
its own rather than rely on that ordering.  rds_ib_conn_path_connect()
takes it once rdma_create_id() has installed the connection as the
context, rds_ib_cm_handle_connect() takes it when it installs the id on
the passive side, and each is dropped after rdma_destroy_id() has
returned: in rds_ib_conn_path_shutdown(), and on the two failure paths
of rds_ib_conn_path_connect() that destroy the id straight away.  With
that the handler cannot find its connection freed under it, whatever
the callbacks do to the other holders - the destroy's initial
reference, a socket's cache, a parent's c_passive, an inc.  None of the
new puts can be the last reference: the shutdown runs on behalf of a
destroy, or of a drop on a connection still in the hash, and the
connect worker runs on a connection still in the hash, and each of
those holds a reference of its own.

rds_ib_cm_initiate_connect() and rds_ib_cm_handle_connect() get a
defensive check of the same kind.  A destroy that began while the
address and route were resolving either waits on c_cm_lock behind the
ROUTE_RESOLVED handler - and its shutdown pass then tears down
whatever the handler set up, QP, cm_id and device reference alike - or
has already destroyed the id, in which case no event for it reaches
the handler.  On the passive side a quiesced connection is unhashed,
so rds_conn_create() cannot hand it to a connect request, and the
listeners are stopped before any IB connection is destroyed at unload.
Neither path is reachable today, then; both functions nevertheless
decline to set up a QP, or install a new cm_id, on a connection whose
destroy has begun, so that the contract does not rest on that
ordering.  rds_ib_cm_initiate_connect() returns success when it
declines: the id is still ic->i_cm_id, for the shutdown to destroy,
and a non-zero return would have the rdma_cm destroy it instead.  An
unload that begins after the check has passed is covered by
rds_ib_add_conn() refusing a device that rds_ib_dev_shutdown() has
marked.
