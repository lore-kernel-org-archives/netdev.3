net/rds: hold connection references in lookup, sockets and c_passive

This patch makes rds_conn_lookup(), __rds_conn_create(), the rs->rs_conn
sendmsg cache and parent->c_passive hold real connection references.
rs_lock now serializes the rs_conn cache, which also resolves a syzbot
KCSAN data race between concurrent rds_sendmsg() calls.

Closes: https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=879c1877016972360186

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but do the new comments match what this path does?

The comment above says that dropping the cached connection "lets the next
sendmsg look up or create a live one". After conn = NULL here, though,
execution goes straight into the if (!conn) block below and calls
rds_conn_create_outgoing() in this same call. A later sendmsg only has to
do the work if that create fails.

The new rs_conn comment in net/rds/rds.h also says:

    The cache owns a connection
    reference, dropped when it is replaced or the socket is
    released, ...

That misses this eviction case, where rds_sendmsg() sets rs_conn to NULL
whenever rds_destroy_pending(conn) is true. If the create that follows
fails, rs_conn stays NULL and nothing replaces it.

Could both comments be updated to cover the eviction path?

[Severity: Medium]
This is a pre-existing issue and was not introduced by this patch, but
should the cache-hit check also compare scope_id against conn->c_dev_if?

rds_conn_lookup() tells connections apart with conn->c_dev_if == dev_if.
The TCP connect path in net/rds/tcp_connect.c uses
sin6.sin6_scope_id = conn->c_dev_if. So a cached connection is tied to
one interface.

If the socket is bound to a global IPv6 address, rs_bound_scope_id is 0.
This earlier check in rds_sendmsg() then accepts any nonzero scope_id:

	if (scope_id != rs->rs_bound_scope_id) {
		if (!scope_id) {
			scope_id = rs->rs_bound_scope_id;
		} else if (rs->rs_bound_scope_id) {

A send to fe80::X with sin6_scope_id = A creates and caches a conn with
c_dev_if = A. A later send to fe80::X with sin6_scope_id = B hits the
cache here and reuses the interface A connection.

Would that message go to fe80::X on link A instead of link B? The
baseline predicate used the same key, and this rewrite keeps it. Adding
conn->c_dev_if == scope_id to the check looks like it would fix this.
