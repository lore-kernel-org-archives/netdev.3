Subject: [PATCH net v4 7/7] net/rds: don't let rds_conn_shutdown() consume a concurrent drop
Date: Sun, 23 Aug 2026 17:37:59 -0700

rds_conn_shutdown() finishes by moving the path from
RDS_CONN_DISCONNECTING to RDS_CONN_DOWN, and also accepts
RDS_CONN_ERROR as the starting state of that final transition, so that
a FIN processed in softirq context during the teardown does not derail
the shutdown into a noisy error path.

But consuming that RDS_CONN_ERROR also consumes the shutdown pass that
came with it: rds_conn_path_drop() sets RDS_CONN_ERROR and then queues
cp_down_w, and a pass that starts on a path already in RDS_CONN_DOWN
is a no-op.  For the FIN case that is harmless - the socket the FIN
arrived on is the very socket the teardown just released.  It is not
harmless for a dropper that attached something to the path first.

rds_tcp_accept_one() is such a dropper.  Its path claim in
rds_tcp_accept_one_path() transitions RDS_CONN_DOWN ->
RDS_CONN_CONNECTING, and a concurrent drop - a FIN on a previous
socket in softirq context, an administrative reset - can put the path
into RDS_CONN_ERROR between that claim and the state check that
follows, which accepts RDS_CONN_ERROR.  The accept then installs the
freshly accepted socket with rds_tcp_set_callbacks() while the queued
teardown - which sampled tc->t_sock before this socket existed - is
still running.  rds_connect_path_complete() fails its transition to
RDS_CONN_UP and drops the path again, queueing the pass that should
reap the socket it just installed.  If the in-flight shutdown's final
transition consumes that drop's RDS_CONN_ERROR, the queued pass finds
the path in RDS_CONN_DOWN and does nothing.  The installed socket is
never torn down: it sits established with its callbacks armed and its
rds_tcp_connection on rds_tcp_tc_list, the peer sees a connection that
nothing ever reads, and the path is wedged in RDS_CONN_DOWN until some
later event drops it again.  Reproduced with widened race windows as
an ever-growing receive queue on a socket owned by a path stuck in
RDS_CONN_DOWN, with the peer's send path wedged behind it.

Make the final transition only DISCONNECTING -> DOWN.  If it fails
because the path is in RDS_CONN_ERROR, a drop raced the teardown:
return quietly and let the pass that drop queued finish the job - it
tears down whatever attached to the path in the meantime, completes
the transition to RDS_CONN_DOWN, and handles the reconnect.  If no
pass was queued because a destroy is pending, rds_conn_path_destroy()
performs the final drop and flush itself.  The FIN case keeps making
progress, one pass later and still without noisy logging; any other
unexpected state keeps today's rds_conn_path_error() handling.

On kernels without the preceding patches the same hazard exists with
the sample-based quiesce; the fix applies there equally.

    New in v4.  Fixes the accept-vs-drop socket leak found while
    re-reviewing patch 6.
