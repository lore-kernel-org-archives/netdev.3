fw_devlink deliberately lets the nearest device pick up dependencies below
class-backed firmware nodes because driverless class devices do not
currently progress through managed device-link states. This can leave
consumers of class suppliers dormant, while sync-state-only links from
class consumers never reach the successful-probe cleanup.

Track class-only devices through equivalent registration and removal
transitions. Mark them probing before device_add() publishes them, complete
their incoming and outgoing links after class interfaces run, and enter the
unbind and no-driver states during device_del(). Preserve firmware links
below class-backed nodes so later-created descendants can acquire their own
links.

Include class registration in wait_for_device_probe() so supplier unbind
cannot race a class consumer that is still being published. Transition
managed links which existed before device_add(), remove stale
waiting_for_supplier attributes and do not revive a link whose supplier has
already started unbinding.

During supplier teardown, wait for class registration to finish, but move
an already registered class consumer directly to the unbinding link state
because it has no driver to release. Keep consumer-autoremove links valid
until class consumer removal without triggering driver-only cleanup
warnings.

Factor the supplier-bound, consumer-bound and cleanup transitions shared
with driver-backed devices. Activate late links involving an already
functional class endpoint instead of trying to reprobe it, and let
sync-state-only links retire without forcing consumer unbind. Ordinary
supplier links cannot defer class registration, so they must not be the
only mechanism on which a class consumer relies for functionality.

Class devices do not match drivers, so distinguish a genuinely unavailable
supplier from a probing or registered class endpoint before relaxing
inferred links. Preserve normal probe and runtime-PM ordering for those
links. Also recognize class-backed nodes when refreshing dependencies after
firmware-tree overlays.

Exclude the internal device-link class because device-link objects are
registered while the device-links lock is held. Document the class-device
state transitions and add KUnit coverage for supplier and consumer links,
pre-existing links, inferred-link preservation, registration waiters and a
concurrent supplier unbind.

Changes v2 -> v3:
  - Replace the framework-specific proxy cleanup API with generic
    class-device managed-link lifecycle handling, as suggested by
    Saravana Kannan
  - Preserve inferred links to probing and registered class suppliers in
    no-driver fallback paths and include class nodes in overlay refresh
  - Cover pre-existing and inferred links, wait_for_device_probe()
    integration, waiting_for_supplier cleanup and supplier-unbind races
  - Document the limits of ordinary supplier links for driverless class
    consumers
  - Handle registered class consumers during supplier teardown without a
    no-op driver release or driver-only cleanup warning
  - Derive class handling inside the shared bound helpers and clarify the
    lifecycle documentation

 State machine
 =============
 
+Driverless class devices participate in the managed-link state machine as
+supplier and consumer endpoints, including as consumers of sync-state-only
+proxy links.  Their registration is treated like a successful driver probe:
+links are completed after :c:func:`device_add()` has finished running class
+interfaces.  During removal, driver-backed consumers are unbound before the
+class device is deleted and its links return to the no-driver state.
+
+Class devices are not probed, so an ordinary supplier link cannot defer their
+registration in the way that it defers a driver probe.  Frameworks must not use
+such a link as the only mechanism guaranteeing that a class consumer's
+supplier is functional.
