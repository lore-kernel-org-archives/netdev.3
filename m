I guess I should have written "inline encryption hardware", which is the
vendor-independent term we've been using in the kernel, just in case
anyone thinks "inline crypto engine" means the "Qualcomm Inline Crypto
Engine" specifically (but really, IMO they are just descriptive phrases
that mean the same thing).  There are many different hardware vendors
that have inline encryption hardware for UFS and/or eMMC.

Their interface is quite simple and doesn't use PKCS#11 at all.  I don't
know where you're seeing anything about PKCS#11.

See also the documentation in Documentation/block/inline-encryption.rst

Yes, and similar developments are also occurring on other CPU
architectures, like Intel's Key Locker.

Neither of these patches is tagged with 'Cc stable', and I don't expect
them to be backported to stable kernels soon.  That being said, it seems
the people using LLMs to find vulnerabilities haven't focused much on
drivers/crypto/ yet.  Once they do, well, they will of course find
vulnerabilities everywhere (accessible from unprivileged userspace via
AF_ALG), and when that happens there may be little choice.

The addition of the af_alg_restrict sysctl (and the possibility of
userspace explicitly choosing to disable restrictions by setting
af_alg_restrict=0) doesn't necessarily mean that problematic
functionality should be, or should have been, moved under
af_alg_restrict=0 rather than removed outright.  It's just an option
that can be used if needed for compatibility reasons, if actual user
reports come in.  If something is not needed at all it can just be
dropped right away.  This actually happens way more often than people
might think, due to the immense amount of unnecessary functionality that
AF_ALG has: *many* crypto algorithms have been removed from AF_ALG over
the years without any complaints, since they were never used.

I'll also note that hardware crypto "decelerator" driver authors are
actually now *depending* on the drivers no longer being usable from
AF_ALG in mainline in order to argue for more relaxed driver inclusion
criteria.  I don't think they can have it both ways!
