Hi.  Thanks for sending this, and continuing to think about this problem.

A few weeks back I had a somewhat different idea for such controls.  I've
been meaning to start a wider discussion about it, but was traveling for
a bit.  What I wrote then:

Generally, if I, or some users I support, need to use unprivileged containers
or user namespaces, then when an 0day comes along, I can hopefully trust them
not to exploit it.  The biggest danger comes from the fact that, right now, if
they can use them, anyone can.  So if someone can trigger some other code running
as user nginx or something, that can become a root vector.

So what if we had a built-in feature or LSM which implemented a credential based
whitelist, entered at firstboot?  Something like

```
# Default deny
uid == 1000  # approved
1005 < uid < 1010  # approved
gid == 1005
security_label = lxc_user_t  # Not sure how far we want to go with this
tty # must have a session
```

Now, if you want to use user namespaces for generic sandboxes for all
users, e.g. to confine browser activity or nginx modules, then this model
may not fit.  Or rather, it might need a few tweaks.

Kees whipped up a proof of concept BPF lsm that implemented this.  A copy
from his email (and let's call it GPLv2 unless he wants to change it to
something like MIT) follows:

Needs:

#

#   policy.sh allow-uid UID        add a uid
#   policy.sh allow-gid GID        add a gid
#   policy.sh deny-uid  UID        remove a uid (only before "lock")
#   policy.sh show                 dump the policy

#
# bpftool takes keys and values as raw bytes in target byte order, so a u32
# uid has to be written little-endian on x86: uid 1000 is "e8 03 00 00", not
# "00 00 03 e8". Getting that backwards silently writes a policy for uid
# 3892510720 instead, which is why this script exists.
