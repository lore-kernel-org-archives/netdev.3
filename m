Yes, the analysis is right, I've sent a V2 that keeps the cached connection=
 when
the request names no interface and only checks c_dev_if when it does.

Yes, but I'm handling that in the larger connection lifetime series=20
("net/rds: make connection lifetime reference-counted").  It=C2=A0moves
rs_conn cache under rs_lock and gives the cache a real reference.  If=20
we did the READ_ONCE() here would still leave the pointer unreferenced
across the test, so I'd rather not let this patch feature creep into
something the ref counting series is already handling.

Thanks!
