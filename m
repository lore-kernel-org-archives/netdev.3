net/smc: order the CDC receive path against buffer publication

The patch initialises the receive accounting first and then publishes
conn->rmb_desc and the SMC-D DMB-nocopy ghost conn->sndbuf_desc with
smp_store_release(), consuming both with smp_load_acquire() in the CDC
receive handlers and bailing while a buffer is unset.  It also gates the
whole sndbuf consumer trigger in smc_cdc_msg_recv_action() on the send
buffer instead of only the nocopy accounting.

Closes: https://sashiko.dev/#/patchset/20260714-b4-disp-835288a6-v2-1-581555ef2145@proton.me?part=1

A couple of questions about the changelog first.

> Gate the whole sndbuf consumer trigger on the send buffer, not just the
> nocopy accounting: smc_tx_prepared_sends() and smc_tx_pending() dereference it
> too. Conforming peers are unaffected.

Simon says: I believe the issue below is a false-positive

[Severity: Medium]
Is "Conforming peers are unaffected" accurate for the SMC-D nocopy half?

On the server, smc_listen_work() publishes the RMB and calls
smc_ism_set_conn() during smc_listen_ism_init(), then sends the CLC accept
carrying our token, and only reaches smcd_buf_attach() after parsing the
client's CLC confirm:

net/smc/af_smc.c:smc_listen_work() {
	...
	smc_conn_save_peer_info(new_smc, cclc);
	...
	if (ini->is_smcd && smc_ism_support_dmb_nocopy(new_smc->conn.lgr->smcd)) {
		rc = smcd_buf_attach(new_smc);
	...
}

The client (smc_connect_ism()) attaches and goes active as soon as it has
sent its confirm, so its very first CDC can legitimately land while the
server's conn->sndbuf_desc is still NULL - which pre-patch is a NULL
dereference of conn->sndbuf_desc->len via smc_tx_pending() ->
smc_tx_sndbuf_nonempty() -> smc_tx_prepared_sends() when the CDC carries
cons_curs_upd_req or urg_data_pending.  Would it be more accurate to
describe that half as a plain setup race rather than peer misbehaviour?

> Fixes: 69cb7dc0218b ("net/smc: add common buffer size in send and receive buffer descriptors")

Simon says: I didn't look closely into this, but I do susspect a 2nd
            fixes tag is unnecessary.

Since the ghost sndbuf_desc hunks address code introduced by ae2be35cbed2,
should there be a second machine-readable Fixes: tag for it, or the split
into two patches offered in the cover notes?  As it stands the dependency
information for the SMC-D half only exists in the non-persistent notes.

Simon says: I would appreciate it if you could look into the concern
            described below.

[Severity: High]
Does this single snapshot hold as a guard in the teardown direction too?
The comment says every consumer below "is skipped while it is NULL", but


the value tested is the snapshot while the consumers re-read the live
field:

net/smc/smc_tx.h:smc_tx_prepared_sends() {
	...
	return smc_curs_diff(conn->sndbuf_desc->len, &sent, &prep);
}

and smc_tx_pending() -> smc_tx_sndbuf_nonempty() -> smc_tx_rdma_writes()
dereference conn->sndbuf_desc again as well.

conn->sndbuf_desc is not monotone.  smcd_buf_detach() frees it and clears
the field:

net/smc/smc_core.c:smcd_buf_detach() {
	...
	smc_ism_detach_dmb(smcd, peer_token);

	kfree(conn->sndbuf_desc);
	conn->sndbuf_desc = NULL;
}

and it is called before the tasklet is stopped:

net/smc/smc_core.c:smc_conn_free() {
	...
	if (lgr->is_smcd) {
		if (!list_empty(&lgr->list))
			smc_ism_unset_conn(conn);
		if (smc_ism_support_dmb_nocopy(lgr->smcd))
			smcd_buf_detach(conn);
		tasklet_kill(&conn->rx_tsklet);
	...
}

smc_ism_unset_conn() only stops smcd_handle_irq() from scheduling new work,
and conn->killed is 0 on a normal close, so the early bail in
smcd_cdc_rx_tsklet() does not help.  smc_cdc_msg_recv() takes only
bh_lock_sock(), which does not exclude a process-context lock_sock() owner
(that is why the function itself tests sock_owned_by_user()).

So can an already running smcd_cdc_rx_tsklet() take a non-NULL snapshot
here, have smcd_buf_detach() kfree() the descriptor underneath it, and then
read freed slab memory in the diff_tx computation below and/or NULL-deref
conn->sndbuf_desc inside smc_tx_prepared_sends()?

The underlying teardown race predates the patch, but two things change
here: the comment now documents protection that only exists for the
NULL -> non-NULL setup transition, and moving the load to function entry
means sndbuf_desc->len can be dereferenced even after the live field has
already been set to NULL, so the freed-pointer read window is wider than
before.  Would loading and testing conn->sndbuf_desc at each point of use
(or fixing the ordering, see the smcd_buf_attach() hunk below) be closer to
what the comment claims?

Simon says: The concern below seems to be pre-existing and
            I don't think it should block progress of this patch.

[Severity: Critical]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but the urgent-data arm of the
same receive path looks like it reads outside the RMB.  In
smc_cdc_handle_urg_data_arrival():

net/smc/smc_cdc.c:smc_cdc_handle_urg_data_arrival() {
	smc_curs_copy(&conn->urg_curs, &conn->local_rx_ctrl.prod, conn);
	...
	base = (char *)conn->rmb_desc->cpu_addr + conn->rx_off;
	if (conn->urg_curs.count)
		conn->urg_rx_byte = *(base + conn->urg_curs.count - 1);
	else
		conn->urg_rx_byte = *(base + conn->rmb_desc->len - 1);
	...
}

conn->local_rx_ctrl.prod comes straight from the peer's CDC, and the only
validation applied is a monotonicity test:

net/smc/smc_cdc.h:smc_cdc_cursor_to_host() {
	temp.count = ntohl(net.count);
	temp.wrap = ntohs(net.wrap);
	if ((old.wrap > temp.wrap) && temp.wrap)
		return;
	if ((old.wrap == temp.wrap) && (old.count > temp.count))
		return;
	smc_curs_copy(local, &temp, conn);
}

Nothing bounds count against conn->rmb_desc->len, and smc_curs_diff() only
clamps the difference to >= 0.  Can a peer that advances prod.count to an
arbitrary value with prod_flags.urg_data_present set make the kernel read
one byte up to ~4 GiB past the RMB, which is then handed to userspace by
smc_rx_recv_urg() via memcpy_to_msg(msg, &conn->urg_rx_byte, 1) - or fault
on an unmapped address?  Should the cursor magnitude be validated against
conn->rmb_desc->len in smc_cdc_cursor_to_host()/smcd_cdc_msg_to_host()?

Simon says: The issue raised below does seem to be of concern.
            Could you take a look?

[Severity: High]
This is the check-vs-use split described above: the gate tests the entry
snapshot, while smc_tx_prepared_sends(conn) and smc_tx_pending(conn) both
re-read conn->sndbuf_desc.  Is there anything preventing the live field
from having become NULL (and the snapshot dangling) between the two?

Simon says: I don't think the concern below should block progress of this patch.

[Severity: Low]
Can this branch ever be taken on the SMC-D path?  The tasklet is only
scheduled from smcd_handle_irq():

net/smc/smc_ism.c:smcd_handle_irq() {
	...
	conn = smcd->conn[dmbno];
	if (conn && !conn->killed)
		tasklet_schedule(&conn->rx_tsklet);
	...
}

and that array slot is only ever filled by smc_ism_set_conn(), which itself
reads conn->rmb_desc->sba_idx and which this patch keeps after the release
store in __smc_buf_create().  Both the slot store and the slot load happen
under smcd->lock, so rmb_desc is already visible by the time the tasklet
runs.

On the teardown side there is no conn->rmb_desc = NULL assignment anywhere
in net/smc, and smc_ism_unset_conn() plus tasklet_kill()/
tasklet_unlock_wait() precede smc_buf_unuse().

So is the comment's rationale ("the connection is published before its RMB
is allocated") describing the SMC-R token-tree window rather than this
path?  For a Cc: stable patch, would it be better to either state the real
reason or drop this hunk, given that the genuine unpublished-buffer window
on SMC-D is the ghost sndbuf_desc?

Simon says: ditto

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug today, but the rmb_desc invariant now lives in the two
entry points while the dereferences stay in the callees:
smc_cdc_msg_recv_action() reads conn->rmb_desc->len with a plain load, and
smc_cdc_handle_urg_data_arrival() reads conn->rmb_desc->cpu_addr and
conn->rmb_desc->len.  That is also inconsistent with the sndbuf_desc
handling in the same patch, which loads and checks locally.

Would a single load plus check inside smc_cdc_msg_recv_action(), or one
helper used by both entry points, keep the invariant next to the
dereference?

Simon says: ditto

[Severity: Medium]
Is "the fully initialised receive state" too strong here?  It looks true
only for the four assignments immediately above the release store.

conn->peer_rmbe_size, conn->peer_rmbe_idx, conn->tx_off and the initial
atomic_set(&conn->peer_rmbe_space, ...) are assigned later, in
smcr_conn_save_peer_info()/smcd_conn_save_peer_info(), which run after
smc_buf_create() on the SMC-D connect path and on the listen path; on both
connect paths smc_rx_init()/smc_tx_init() also run after publication.

A CDC that now passes the new rmb_desc gate in that window still executes:

net/smc/smc_cdc.c:smc_cdc_msg_recv_action() {
	...
	diff_cons = smc_curs_diff(conn->peer_rmbe_size, &cons_old,
				  &conn->local_rx_ctrl.cons);
	...
}

with conn->peer_rmbe_size == 0, still atomic_add()s into
conn->peer_rmbe_space which setup then clobbers with atomic_set(), can
still set conn->urg_state = SMC_URG_NOTYET before smc_rx_init() overwrites
it with SMC_URG_READ, can still call the pre-SMC sk_data_ready
(sock_def_readable rather than smc_rx_wake_up), and can leave peer-chosen
cursors in conn->local_rx_ctrl that setup never re-initialises.

So the "lost update by setup" class the changelog describes appears to be
eliminated only for bytes_to_rcv and sndbuf_space.  Would a single
readiness flag published once setup completes, or deferring the token-tree
insertion and smc_ism_set_conn() until the connection is fully
initialised, cover the buffers and the remaining state with one barrier?
At minimum, could the comment be narrowed to the fields it actually
orders?

Simon says: I would appreciate it if you could take a look into
            the issue raised below.

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but should the unpublish side be fixed in
the same series, since this patch establishes the publication protocol for
the ghost buffer?  Only the publish side gains ordering; the free side
gets neither ordering nor a wait for the consumer:

net/smc/smc_core.c:smcd_buf_detach() {
	...
	smc_ism_detach_dmb(smcd, peer_token);

	kfree(conn->sndbuf_desc);
	conn->sndbuf_desc = NULL;
}

and both callers free before cancelling the consumer:

net/smc/smc_core.c:smc_conn_free() {
	...
		if (smc_ism_support_dmb_nocopy(lgr->smcd))
			smcd_buf_detach(conn);
		tasklet_kill(&conn->rx_tsklet);
	...
}

net/smc/smc_core.c:smc_conn_kill() {
	...
		if (smc_ism_support_dmb_nocopy(conn->lgr->smcd))
			smcd_buf_detach(conn);
		if (soft)
			tasklet_kill(&conn->rx_tsklet);
		else
			tasklet_unlock_wait(&conn->rx_tsklet);
	...
}

smc_conn_kill() runs from the link group terminate worker with no socket
lock at all, and smc_cdc_msg_recv() only takes bh_lock_sock(), so there is
no common lock serialising conn->sndbuf_desc against an in-flight
smcd_cdc_rx_tsklet().

Would stopping the tasklet before detaching and freeing the ghost buffer,
mirroring the publish-last ordering introduced here, close this?
