With CONFIG_DPLL_REFCNT_TRACKER the DPLL core keeps the stack traces of
unreleased device and pin references in debugfs. The entries do not
name their owner, so add library helpers that snapshot the entries
present before a test creates its devices and fail when an entry that
is not in the snapshot still holds references afterwards. An entry in
the snapshot belongs to an object of another driver and is ignored
even when its content changed, since other drivers take and drop
references while the tests run. The teardown of a device releases its
references before the write to live returns, so the entries are
expected to be gone at the first look; the check still polls for a
while before it reports a leak, so that it does not fail on a single
read. Attributing by name means that a leak of an earlier run goes
unnoticed, that an object reusing the address of a freed one from the
snapshot can hide a leak and that an object another driver registers
while a script runs is reported as a leak, which is accepted, the
entries carry nothing better to go by. ref_tracker removes the file of
a freed object from a work item and a read of it fails until then, so
the snapshot waits for such files to go away and records only entries
it can read, or the file of the probe device could get into it and hide
the next object allocated at that address. A second run alongside would
have its devices attributed to this one, which is one more reason for
the lock every script takes.

Whether the tracker works is probed with a throwaway device, which has
to show entries while it is live and to drain them once it is deleted,
so that a kernel without the tracker is told apart from a broken
simulator and from a leak. The entries exist without
CONFIG_DPLL_REFCNT_TRACKER too and just stay empty, so a probe that saw
no reference is a skip unless /proc/config.gz says the tracker is built
in, which makes it a failure. The probe runs as the first test of the
stress script, which gains a final leak check that is skipped when an
earlier test left a device behind, and of the new dpll_reftrack.sh,
which registers a device, removes it and verifies that no reference
survived. The snapshot file lives next to the lock file under /run, for
the same reason the lock file does not live in /tmp. The library mounts
debugfs when nothing else did, like it does for configfs, and the
selftest config enables the tracker together with CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL,
which it depends on, debugfs and CONFIG_IKCONFIG_PROC for the look at
/proc/config.gz.

v4:
- wait for the files of freed objects to go away before a snapshot and
  record only entries that can be read
- a probe that saw no reference is a failure when /proc/config.gz says
  the tracker is built in, a skip otherwise
- skip the final leak check of the stress script when an earlier test
  left a device behind
- record the debugfs mount before mounting
- say that objects another driver registers during a run are reported
- enable CONFIG_IKCONFIG_PROC in the selftest config, the probe reads
  /proc/config.gz
- say that the probe device could not be created or deployed, not only
  created
- add the Reviewed-by given to v3 (Ivan Vecera)

v3:
- say what the leak check waits for instead of a concurrent dump
  holding references, which nothing does (Ivan Vecera)
- follow the move of the selftests to
  tools/testing/selftests/drivers/dpll

v2:
- keep the config file sorted and quote the ret expansions (netdev CI
  shellcheck)
