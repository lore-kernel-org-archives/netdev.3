net: devmem: unmap dma_buf synchronously on queue uninstall

This patch adds net_devmem_dmabuf_binding_unmap(), which runs under
binding->lock and clears binding->sgt and binding->attachment so that
unmapping is idempotent. It is called from mp_dmabuf_devmem_uninstall()
when the last bound RX queue is uninstalled, so the dma_buf is no longer
unmapped against a freed dma_dev after device unregister.

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but the comment on binding->lock in net/core/devmem.h
still reads:

	/* Protect dev */
	struct mutex lock;

The lock now also protects binding->sgt and binding->attachment, and the
lockdep_assert_held() here enforces that. Should the comment in the header
be updated as well?

[Severity: High]
Can this deferred unmap still run against a freed dma_dev when the binding
was already unbound before the device went away?

The commit message says the fix covers unregister "while userspace still
holds a netlink or TCP socket reference". However, the only synchronous
unmap is in mp_dmabuf_devmem_uninstall(), and dev_memory_provider_uninstall()
only reaches that for RX queues whose rxq->mp_params is still set.

Closing the netlink socket does this, with no unmap:

netdev_nl_sock_priv_destroy()
  net_devmem_unbind_dmabuf()
    xa_erase(&net_devmem_dmabuf_bindings, binding->id);
    netif_mp_close_rxq()
      __netif_mp_close_rxq()
        memset(&rxq->mp_params, 0, sizeof(rxq->mp_params));
    percpu_ref_kill(&binding->ref);

Other references can keep the binding alive past that point. On RX,
unreturned devmem tokens keep the old page pool alive. On TX, unacked
devmem skbs in a TCP retransmit queue hold refs taken via
net_devmem_get_net_iov(). The TX binding can be created through
netdev_nl_bind_tx_doit(), which does not check for CAP_NET_ADMIN.

A later unregister then finds no installed provider, so
mp_dmabuf_devmem_uninstall() is never called for this binding. After the
parent device is freed (for example in nsim_bus_dev_release()), dropping
the last reference goes through:

__net_devmem_dmabuf_binding_free()
  net_devmem_dmabuf_binding_unmap()
    dma_buf_unmap_attachment_unlocked()
      unmap_udmabuf()
        dma_unmap_sg_attrs()    <-- freed attach->dev

That looks like the same KASAN report quoted in the commit message.

The follow-up commit "net: devmem: detach TX bindings on NETDEV_UNREGISTER"
fixes the TX case while the netlink socket is still open. Its
net_devmem_dev_unregister() only walks net_devmem_dmabuf_bindings, though,
and unbound bindings are no longer in that xarray.

A narrower variant needs no extra references. The unbind_w work queued by
net_devmem_dmabuf_binding_release() runs asynchronously, and nothing makes
it run before device removal.

Would a complete fix need to track every binding that is still mapped
against a device, and not only the ones installed on an RX queue?

[Severity: High]
Is it safe to unmap here just because bound_rxqs became empty? Nothing
here checks whether the hardware queue has actually stopped using the
binding.

On queue lease teardown the physical NIC is still registered and running:

netkit_queue_unlease()
  netdev_rx_queue_unlease()
    netif_rxq_cleanup_unlease()
      __netif_mp_close_rxq(phys_rxq->dev, rxq_idx, &p);
      __netif_mp_uninstall_rxq(virt_rxq, &p);
        mp_dmabuf_devmem_uninstall()
          net_devmem_dmabuf_binding_unmap()

If the reconfig fails, __netif_mp_close_rxq() only warns:

	err = netdev_rx_queue_reconfig(dev, rxq_idx, &qcfg[0], &qcfg[1]);
	WARN_ON(err && err != -ENETDOWN);

netdev_rx_queue_reconfig() can fail in ndo_queue_mem_alloc() before
ndo_queue_stop() is called. It can also fail in stop or start, with the
old queue restored. In both cases the old devmem page pool keeps running,
and its ring holds DMA addresses from binding->sgt.

netif_rxq_cleanup_unlease() still calls uninstall unconditionally. The
virtual rxq is the one recorded in bound_rxqs, so removing it empties the
xarray. The dma-buf is then unmapped and detached while the NIC can still
DMA into those IOVAs, and the pool can keep refilling from
binding->chunk_pool.

Before this patch the mapping lasted until __net_devmem_dmabuf_binding_free()
ran, which only happens after every page pool has dropped its binding ref.
The commit message only talks about unregistration. Was the lease
teardown path also meant to unmap synchronously here?

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but the comment on the ref field of struct
net_devmem_dmabuf_binding in net/core/devmem.h still says:

	 * The binding undos itself and unmaps the underlying dmabuf once all
	 * those refs are dropped and the binding is no longer desired or in
	 * use.

With this call, the mapping can go away while netlink, page pool or
net_iov refs are still held. The follow-up commit "net: devmem: detach TX
bindings on NETDEV_UNREGISTER" adds another early unmap in
net_devmem_dev_unregister(). Should this comment be updated to match?
