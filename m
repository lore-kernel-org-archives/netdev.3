Per Documents/process/coding-assistants.rst it means an LLM contributed in
some way, but sungbyeongchan patch had a reproducer and Shubham validated
it under KMSAN

The short fragment is never linked, and the half-built inc is freed when th=
e
connection shuts down, so it doesn't reach the socket.

I think dropping just the offending message, and skipping the rest
of its fragments by sequence, would be a reasonable refinement for
net-next.  And it would make sense to treat the header-mismatch exit
the same way at the same time.  I'd be happy to review patches for those.

The landed fix does refuse to deliver the message though. The conn drop is
the same policy the other exits in that function use too, so it's the right
solution for stable.  Patches welcome on the other points though.

Thanks!
