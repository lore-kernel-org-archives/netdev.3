Subject: [PATCH net-next v10 09/13] net/rds: hold a connection reference from struct rds_incoming
Date: Fri, 16 Oct 2026 20:23:15 -0700

struct rds_incoming->i_conn stores a pointer to the connection a message
it belongs to, for both received messages and messages the socket sends.
But without taking a reference, nothing keeps that connection alive.
Embedded as the messages m_inc, an inc routinely outlives the connection
it points at, by sitting in the socket's receive queue until the
application reads it, while the connection is destroyed under it - and
every dereference of i_conn after that point touches freed memory. Netns
teardown and unloading rds.ko cannot do that to a live socket, which
pins both, but a transport unload can: rds_find_bound() does not check
the transport, so a socket bound with one transport (SO_RDS_TRANSPORT)
can hold incs that arrived over another transport's connection, and
unloading that other transport destroys the connection while the socket
stays open.

Chengfeng Ye reported one way to reach it, where the socket info
callbacks walk a receive queue after rmmod freed the connections:

  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in rds6_inc_info_copy+0x459/0x530 [rds]

   rds_exit+0x1a/0xc40 [rds]
   __do_sys_delete_module+0x30a/0x4d0

That report has rds.ko itself unloading with an RDS socket still open,
which the socket's module reference would normally prevent, so the
reproduction appears to rely on a forced unload; the cross-transport
case above needs none. Closing the socket gets there too, with no reader
of i_conn other than RDS itself: freeing an IB inc dereferences i_conn
to hand the inc and its fragments back to the connection's recycle
cache, so draining the receive queue of a socket whose connection is
gone crashes in the transport:

  panic
  ...
  rds_ib_recv_cache_put (net/rds/ib_recv.c:703)
  rds_ib_inc_free (net/rds/ib_recv.c:207)
  rds_clear_recv_queue (net/rds/recv.c:909)
  rds_release (net/rds/af_rds.c:212)
  __sock_release (net/socket.c:649)
  sock_close (net/socket.c:1336)

with the freed connection confirmed by its now-zero reference count:

  -trace[9]["inc"].i_conn.c_refcount
  (struct kref){
          .refcount = (refcount_t){
                  .refs = (atomic_t){
                          .counter = (int)0,
                  },
          },
  }

Now that connections are reference counted, make every holder of i_conn
own a reference.  The pointer is assigned in six places - rds_inc_init()
and rds_inc_path_init() for received messages, rds_recv_incoming() when
it re-points an inc at the connection it arrived on, and
rds_send_queue_rm(), rds_send_probe() and the congestion-map path of
rds_send_xmit() for m_inc - and each of them now takes a reference.  The
references are dropped from rds_inc_put() and rds_message_put(), which
are the points where the last user of the pointer goes away.
rds_recv_incoming() takes the new reference before dropping the old one,
so re-pointing an inc at the connection it already refers to cannot free
it.  rds_inc_put() drops its reference through a local copy, since
inc_free() may free the memory the inc lives in.

This keeps a connection allocated for as long as messages that arrived
over it are queued on sockets, which is longer than before.  What
lingers is the quiesced connection, its per-path workqueues (idle,
every work cancelled) and the transport's per-connection state,
including an IB connection's receive caches: rds_conn_destroy() still
quiesces the connection synchronously, so nothing runs on any of it.
It also means the transport cannot unload while such a datagram is
unread - rds_conn_wait_conns_freed() waits, warning every ten seconds,
until the application reads or closes.  That is the intended
behaviour: teardown does not discard queued data, and unloading over a
live reference would be a use-after-free in the transport's text.

The final rds_conn_put() runs the free path, which destroys the per-path
workqueues and therefore may sleep, so the last reference has to be
dropped from process context.  It always is.  While a connection is
alive its hash-table entry holds the initial reference, so a put from a
completion handler or tasklet can never be the last one; that reference
is dropped by rds_conn_destroy(), from process context, after the
connection has been quiesced and its queued messages freed.  The
references that survive that point are the ones held by incs on socket
receive queues and by messages on socket send queues, and those are
dropped from recvmsg and from close - process context in both cases.

This is not a stable candidate, and is marked for the stable tooling to
skip so that it is not picked up without the patches it depends on:
reaching the use-after-free requires freeing a connection out from under
a live socket, which needs CAP_SYS_MODULE, and the fix depends on the
connection reference counting introduced earlier in this series.

Based on the Oracle UEK commit "net/rds: fix crash by
expanding kref coverage to rds_incoming.i_conn".

[achender: port to net-next: same six assignment sites, but upstream
 splits the message free across rds_message_unpin_worker(), so the
 m_inc reference is dropped from a shared rds_message_free() helper
 that both paths call; rds_recv_incoming() takes the new reference
 before dropping the old; rewrite commit message]
