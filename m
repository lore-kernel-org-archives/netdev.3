Not dumb, and that's what the attach check does: a generic program
fails to attach while a provider socket is bound, and a bind with one
attached falls back to copy mode. With those two, the drop in 07 can't
trigger, so it goes, as I told Stan. I agree generic doesn't
deserve more than that.

And I'd rather not tie the bringup to a native program, as driver ZC
does. That adds state: attach and detach would install and remove the
provider, restart the queues and handle that failing half way, and
whether a bound socket gets zero copy would depend on the program. Here
a socket depends only on its allocator, set up at bind, and the program
just picks the packets that go to it; the two are orthogonal.

That also leaves room for a mode without an XDP program, steering flows
to the queue like devmem and io_uring zcrx do ;-)

TBH I fail to see how moving 1 to a separate set would make it easier to
review.

I'm not saying we're orphaning anything. I am trying to reuse as much as
possible, but some parts does not fit. Like using xsk_buff_head -- the
page_pool return netmems. Type type is PAGE_POOL, and driver typically
use a stack allocated xdp_buff.

The end goal is enable the XSK core, so that a netdev driver does not
need to build a secondary shadow driver for XSK. Instead, driver
supports the page pool + queue restart APIs, and you can then use XSK,
devmem, and iouring zc with less code. Initially Rx, but we need a plan
for Tx as well at some point.

It would be awesome if over time we move from the existing "shadow
driver" world, to page pool and the provider, and MEM_TYPE_XSK_BUFF_POOL
goes once the last one has. Until then driver ZC keeps working as it
does today, and v2 will have numbers for it. FWIW, I'll keep converting
drivers too, not just land the core.

The fact that Linux does not have a driver ABI, which IMO a strength, is
just for work like this. We can clean up drivers, as the world change,
without keeping old stuff around forever.
