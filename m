can: dev: can_fill_info(): don't wake up controller if interface is down

This adds a netif_running() check to can_get_size() and can_fill_info().
When the interface is down, do_get_berr_counter() is no longer called and
IFLA_CAN_BERR_COUNTER is no longer reported. The check used to be in the
flexcan driver and is now in the CAN core, so it applies to all drivers.

[Severity: High]
Is this fix complete? Later in the same expression, can_fill_info() calls
can_tdc_fill_info() for IFLA_CAN_TDC and IFLA_CAN_XL_TDC. That path can
still read controller registers while the interface is down:

drivers/net/can/dev/netlink.c:can_tdc_fill_info() {
    ...
	if (tdc_is_enabled) {
		...
		} else if (dbt_params->do_get_auto_tdcv) {
			err = dbt_params->do_get_auto_tdcv(dev, &tdcv);
		}
    ...
}

Nothing on this path checks netif_running().

On Xilinx CAN-FD, xcan_get_auto_tdcv() reads XCAN_SR without taking a
runtime PM reference. By contrast, xcan_get_berr_counter() calls
pm_runtime_get_sync() before it reads anything:

drivers/net/can/xilinx_can.c:xcan_get_auto_tdcv() {
	...
	*tdcv = FIELD_GET(XCAN_SR_TDCV_MASK, priv->read_reg(priv, XCAN_SR_OFFSET));
	...
}

After probe, or after xcan_close() calls pm_runtime_put(), the device is
runtime suspended. At that point xcan_runtime_suspend() has disabled bus_clk
and can_clk. xcan_close() does not clear ctrlmode, so TDC_AUTO stays set
after every ifdown.

TDC_AUTO can also be turned on while the interface is down. For example,
"ip link set canX type can bitrate ... dbitrate ... fd on" goes through
can_calc_tdco(), which enables TDC_AUTO when the driver supports it. After
that, the RTM_NEWLINK notification or an unprivileged "ip -d link show"
would end up in:

can_fill_info()
  can_tdc_fill_info()
    xcan_get_auto_tdcv()
      priv->read_reg(priv, XCAN_SR_OFFSET)

and the read happens with the register clock gated. Depending on the SoC,
this either returns garbage or causes a bus stall or external abort.
rcar_canfd_get_auto_tdcv() also does a live readl() of cfdsts from this
path, whatever the interface state.

The commit message says "This fixes a generic logic problem that exists on
all platforms". Given that, should the do_get_auto_tdcv() readback in
can_tdc_fill_info() also be gated on netif_running()? Alternatively, should
xcan_get_auto_tdcv() take a runtime PM reference?

[Severity: Low]
This also changes what userspace sees for every driver that implements
do_get_berr_counter(). Together with the matching change in can_get_size(),
IFLA_CAN_BERR_COUNTER is now left out of RTM_GETLINK and RTM_NEWLINK
messages whenever the interface is down. As a result, "ip -details link
show" no longer prints berr-counter for a down interface.

Before this patch the attribute was always present:

- flexcan, xilinx_can and c_can woke the device and reported the real
  counters.
- m_can_get_berr_counter() and mcp251xfd_get_berr_counter() returned 0 with
  zeroed counters when the interface was not up:

drivers/net/can/m_can/m_can.c:m_can_get_berr_counter() {
    ...
	if (!(dev->flags & IFF_UP))
		return 0;
    ...
}

The netlink path can no longer reach these driver-level IFF_UP checks.

The commit named in Fixes:, ec56acfef2af1, was added so that userspace could
call flexcan_get_berr_counter() even while the interface was down. This
patch reverses that behaviour rather than fixing a defect in it, and it is
tagged for stable.

Could the commit message say that IFLA_CAN_BERR_COUNTER is no longer
reported for down interfaces, and explain why that change is acceptable for
stable?
