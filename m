net/rds: include the scope id in the sendmsg connection cache check

This patch adds a comparison of rs->rs_conn->c_dev_if against the
request's scope_id to the connection cache test in rds_sendmsg(). The aim
is that sends to the same link-local address through different interfaces
go through the lookup path and use the matching connection, not the cached
one.

[Severity: High]
On a socket bound to a link-local address and connected to a
non-link-local peer, can send() and sendto() to the same peer now end up
with different connection keys?

Take bind(fe80::a%X) followed by connect(G), where G is a global address.
rds_bind() stores rs_bound_scope_id = X, and rds_connect() takes the
non-link-local branch:

net/rds/af_rds.c:rds_connect() {
    ...
		} else {
			rs->rs_conn_scope_id = 0;
		}
    ...
}

A sendto(G) starts with scope_id 0. The namelen != 0 block in
rds_sendmsg() then falls back to the bound scope:

		if (scope_id != rs->rs_bound_scope_id) {
			if (!scope_id) {
				scope_id = rs->rs_bound_scope_id;

So sendto(G) creates and caches a connection with c_dev_if = X.

A send() with no destination takes scope_id = rs->rs_conn_scope_id, which
is 0. It never gets that fallback, because the fallback sits inside the
else if (namelen != 0) branch.

With the new c_dev_if == scope_id test, X != 0, so the cache misses.
rds_conn_create_outgoing(..., 0) then returns a connection with a
link-local c_laddr and c_dev_if = 0, and c_bound_if = 0 from
__rds_conn_create(). rs->rs_conn is overwritten with that connection.

For TCP, rds_tcp_conn_path_connect() binds the kernel socket with:

		sin6.sin6_addr = conn->c_laddr;
		...
		sin6.sin6_scope_id = conn->c_dev_if;

That socket has no sk_bound_dev_if, so __inet6_bind() rejects the
link-local bind:

			/* Binding to link-local address requires an interface */
			if (!sk->sk_bound_dev_if) {
				err = -EINVAL;

Wouldn't that connection never come up, so that data queued by send()
stalls? An application that mixes sendto(G) and send() would also switch
rs_conn between the two connections on every call.

Before this series, send() used rs_bound_scope_id, which matches what
sendto() computes. The earlier patch "net/rds: keep the connected peer's
scope id apart from the bound one" switched send() to rs_conn_scope_id.
This patch then removes the faddr/tos-only cache hit that was hiding the
mismatch.

The commit message says:

  With the previous patch a send without a destination carries the
  connected peer's scope, so the comparison is exact for it too.

Does that hold when the bound address is link-local and the peer is not?

Would it help to apply the rs_bound_scope_id fallback to the namelen == 0
path too, or to store the effective scope in rds_connect(), so both paths
use the same key?

>  		conn = rs->rs_conn;

[Severity: Medium]
Can rs->rs_conn change between the checks above and this assignment?

By this point lock_sock() has been released, and every access to
rs->rs_conn in this test is a plain load. Other senders on the same
socket store to it without a lock in the else branch:

		rs->rs_conn = conn;

That seems to allow a sequence like this:

T1: sendto(fe80::x%ifB) passes the checks against the cached connB
T2: sendto(fe80::x%ifA) misses the cache and stores rs->rs_conn = connA
T1: reloads rs->rs_conn and queues the ifB message on connA

The result would be the same wrong-interface send this patch is trying to
close, reached through a race. It requires the compiler to reload
rs->rs_conn, which C allows for plain accesses.

The unsnapshotted read was already there before this patch. With this
change, though, a socket that alternates interfaces rewrites rs_conn on
every send.

Would reading rs->rs_conn once with READ_ONCE(), running all the
comparisons on that snapshot, and publishing with WRITE_ONCE() close this?
