net: stmmac: take ownership of saved RX state at poll entry

The saved partial-frame RX state is now taken and cleared at the start of
stmmac_rx() and stmmac_rx_zc(). It is saved again only if the frame is
still incomplete when the poll ends. The saved skb is also dropped in
stmmac_reset_rx_queue() and __free_dma_rx_desc_resources().

[Severity: Medium]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but can a multi-descriptor
frame reach the stack as a truncated fragment when napi_build_skb() fails
on a descriptor that is not the last one?

The allocation failure path in stmmac_rx() does not set error:

	skb = napi_build_skb(page_address(buf->page),
			     rx_q->napi_skb_frag_size);
	if (!skb) {
		page_pool_recycle_direct(rx_q->page_pool,
					 buf->page);
		buf->page = NULL;
		rx_dropped++;
		count++;
		goto drain_data;
	}

When status & rx_not_ls is set, drain_data jumps back to read_again. At
that point skb == NULL and error == 0, and len still holds the bytes of
the dropped prefix.

With no XDP program attached, stmmac_xdp_run_prog() returns NULL. The next
descriptor of the same frame then builds a new skb from a mid-frame
buffer.

On the last descriptor, len still includes the dropped prefix. So
pskb_trim() does nothing, because len is not smaller than skb->len:

	return (len < skb->len) ? __pskb_trim(skb, len) : 0;

Wouldn't that pass a mid-payload fragment, with its FCS still attached,
to napi_gro_receive()? Its ip_summed would come from the status of the
whole frame, and rx_bytes would be counted with the full-frame len.

The same thing seems to happen across a poll boundary. In that case
in_progress saves skb == NULL, error == 0 and len.

The old status & rx_not_ls save condition behaved the same way. Later in
the series, "net: stmmac: drop multi-buffer frames in XDP mode" sets
error for rx_not_ls when XDP is enabled. The non-XDP path is unchanged.

[Severity: High]
The commit message says that without this drain, a partial frame saved
before suspend would be resumed "with descriptors from the freshly
initialized ring". Is the ring actually freshly initialized on the
stmmac_resume() path?

stmmac_resume() does:

	stmmac_reset_queues_param(priv);

	stmmac_free_tx_skbufs(priv);
	stmmac_clear_descriptors(priv, &priv->dma_conf);

	ret = stmmac_hw_setup(ndev);

stmmac_clear_rx_descriptors() calls stmmac_init_rx_desc() on every RX
descriptor, and that only sets ownership bits:

- dwmac4_rd_init_rx_desc() and dwxgmac2_init_rx_desc() OR OWN|BUF1V into
  des3.
- enh_desc_init_rx_desc() and ndesc_init_rx_desc() OR RDES0_OWN into
  des0.

Buffer addresses are never reprogrammed and empty slots are not refilled.
stmmac_init_dma_engine() then sets the RX tail pointer to buf_alloc_num,
which gives every descriptor back to the DMA.

Suppose page_pool_alloc_pages() failed in stmmac_rx_refill() for the
slots used by the saved partial frame. The loop then breaks before
stmmac_set_desc_addr():

	if (!buf->page) {
		buf->page = page_pool_alloc_pages(rx_q->page_pool, gfp);
		if (!buf->page)
			break;
	}

Those descriptors keep the DMA addresses of pages that state.skb now
owns, and buf->page == NULL.

With this change, stmmac_reset_rx_queue() returns those pages to the
page_pool through dev_kfree_skb_any(). The same descriptors are then
re-armed and the DMA is restarted.

Can the device then DMA into pages that have already been recycled or
freed?

There is a separate problem on dwmac4 and xgmac. A descriptor that was
written back but not refilled before suspend still holds write-back data
in des0/des1. For example, dwmac4_wrback_get_rx_vlan_tci() reads the VLAN
tag from des0. Re-arming that descriptor would make the DMA treat the
write-back data as a buffer address.

The re-arm-without-refill behaviour predates this patch: an earlier
upstream re-init on resume was reverted. Before this patch, the stale skb
would also have been completed and freed on the first poll after resume,
while those descriptors were still armed. So this change frees the pages
earlier rather than creating the problem.

Since the resume handling depends on the ring being freshly initialized,
should the commit message be corrected? And should the resume path refill
and reprogram the RX descriptors before the DMA is restarted?
