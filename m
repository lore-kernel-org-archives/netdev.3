net/rds: make rds_destroy_pending() cover single-connection destroy

This adds a conn->c_destroy_in_prog flag, set by rds_conn_destroy() before
the unhash + synchronize_rcu() sequence, and tests it in
rds_destroy_pending() so that the work-arming sites stop queueing on the
path workqueues while a single connection is being torn down.  The dead
RDS_DESTROY_PENDING cp_flags bit and its remaining test in
rds_ib_is_unloading() are removed.

Two comments on the changelog and the new code comments below.

>     rds_conn_destroy() is not limited to the global paths:
>     rds_ib_cm_connect_complete() destroys a single connection whose peer

[Severity: Medium]
Does rds_ib_cm_connect_complete() still call rds_conn_destroy()?  At the
baseline (8830e65) and at this commit, the version-mismatch arm in
net/rds/ib_cm.c reads:

	if (conn->c_version < RDS_PROTOCOL_VERSION) {
		if (conn->c_version != RDS_PROTOCOL_COMPAT_VERSION) {
			pr_notice("RDS/IB: Connection <%pI6c,%pI6c> version %u.%u no longer supported\n",
				  ...);
			rds_conn_drop(conn);
			return;
		}
	}

git grep rds_conn_destroy in net/rds/ matches only connection.c, rds.h,
ib_rdma.c, loop.c and tcp.c - ib_cm.c has no call at all.  The later patch
in this series ("net/rds: pin the connection across RDMA-CM event
handling") also states that this path "has meanwhile been switched to
rds_conn_drop() by commit f97d8c7bab78".

If that is right, can the described rds_cong_queue_updates() race against a
freed cp_wq be reached at all through the named caller?

Looking at the five remaining callers, four already satisfy one of the two
old terms:

  rds_ib_destroy_nodev_conns()  - only from rds_ib_exit(), after
                                  rds_ib_set_unloading()
  rds_tcp_destroy_conns()       - only from rds_tcp_exit(), after
                                  rds_tcp_set_unloading()
  rds_loop_exit()               - after rds_loop_set_unloading()
  rds_tcp_kill_sock()           - from rds_tcp_exit_net(), where either
                                  check_net() is false or ->t_unloading is
                                  already set

The one caller that does appear to escape the old predicate is the loop
pernet exit, which the changelog does not mention:

	rds_conn_exit()
	  rds_loop_net_exit()		/* unregister_pernet_device() */
	    rds_loop_exit_net()
	      rds_loop_kill_conns()
	        rds_conn_destroy()
	  rds_loop_exit()		/* sets the loop unloading flag */

rds_loop_kill_conns() runs for every live netns, so check_net() is still
true, and the unloading flag is only set afterwards by rds_loop_exit().

Given that, is the Fixes: cdc306a5c9cd3 ("rds: make v3.1 as compat
version") attribution correct?  RDS_DESTROY_PENDING was never set on the
loop path, so removing its last set_bit does not look like what left this
caller unguarded.  Would it make sense to re-point the changelog (and the
Fixes: tag, or drop it) at the rds_loop_net_exit() path instead, so that a
stable backport is not requested for the version-mismatch path?

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but is the "which all test rds_destroy_pending() under
rcu_read_lock()" claim accurate?  There are three arming sites in tree that
do not.

rds_send_worker() and rds_recv_worker() in net/rds/threads.c re-arm with a
bare queue:

	case -EAGAIN:
		rds_stats_inc(s_send_immediate_retry);
		queue_delayed_work(cp->cp_wq, &cp->cp_send_w, 0);
		break;

The previous patch's changelog explains that these self-requeues are
covered by the cancel_delayed_work_sync() calls in
rds_conn_path_destroy(), but nothing in the code says so.

rds_conn_path_drop() skips the predicate entirely when destroy is true:

	rcu_read_lock();
	if (!destroy && rds_destroy_pending(cp->cp_conn)) {
		rcu_read_unlock();
		return;
	}
	queue_work(cp->cp_wq, &cp->cp_down_w);
	rcu_read_unlock();

That bypass is needed by rds_conn_path_destroy() itself, but it is also
used from outside the destroy path, by rds_ib_dev_shutdown() on IB device
removal:

	list_for_each_entry(ic, &rds_ibdev->conn_list, ib_node)
		rds_conn_path_drop(&ic->conn->c_path[0], true);

There, neither check_net(), ->t_unloading nor the new c_destroy_in_prog can
suppress the queue_work().

Could the comment be reworded to name the exceptions, so a later reader
does not conclude the new flag closes the whole window?  The same wording
appears in the rds.h comment below.

> +	WRITE_ONCE(conn->c_destroy_in_prog, true);
