Fair enough. I understand your concern about encoding qdisc identity
into drop reasons. My view is that qdisc-specific drop reasons help
pinpoint exact code paths and tunables, which is valuable for production
debugging. Eric's FQ commit (5765c7f6e317) already established this
pattern with FQ_BAND_LIMIT, FQ_HORIZON_LIMIT, and FQ_FLOW_LIMIT.

I'll send a v3 and expect other maintainers to review this.
