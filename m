Extend the stress script with tests that register and unregister
devices from several processes at once and that keep a number of
devices with many pins live at the same time, checking that every one
of them is visible on netlink with all its pins.

The workers run in subshells, so the parent cannot track the device a
worker has in flight. Each worker removes it from its own exit trap
instead, and the parent reserves a range of clock IDs for every worker,
so that the devices of a worker cannot collide with those of another
worker or of the parent and whatever a killed worker left behind can
be removed by name, at the end of the test and from the cleanup
handler. The handler stops the recorded workers together with the jobs
of the shell, gives them a few seconds to run their exit traps before
forcing the survivors, and goes on without a worker that does not die,
since one stuck in the kernel would hang the teardown. A worker that
a signal interrupts exits with the status of the signal, inside a trap
$? is the status of whatever ran last and the worker could pass for one
that finished. bash reaps a worker as soon as it exits, so a recorded
pid may have been handed out again by the time the handler runs, and it
signals a pid only while that is still a child of the script. Deleting
a device treats a part of it that is gone by the time its step runs as
removed, so that a removal running concurrently with the one of a
worker does not turn into a spurious failure. The workers inherit the
open lock file of the library, so the lock is held until the script and
every worker have exited.

v4:
- signal a recorded pid only while it is still a running child of the
  script, bash reaps finished workers on its own and the pid may have
  been reused
- rename the "maximum devices" test to "many devices" and check that
  every device shows all its pins
- say what happens to a helper of a worker that is stuck in the kernel
- exit a signalled worker with the status of the signal, it could pass
  for one that finished

v3:
- follow the move of the selftests to
  tools/testing/selftests/drivers/dpll

v2:
- quote the failed and ret expansions (netdev CI shellcheck)
