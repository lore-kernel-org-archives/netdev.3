net/rds: hold connection references in lookup, sockets and c_passive

This patch makes every escaping struct rds_connection pointer carry a real
reference: rds_conn_lookup() and __rds_conn_create() hand one to the caller,
the rs->rs_conn sendmsg cache owns one, and parent->c_passive owns one and
becomes RCU-annotated. It also serializes the rs_conn cache under rs_lock,
which closes a syzbot-reported KCSAN data race between concurrent
rds_sendmsg() calls.

Closes: https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=879c1877016972360186

[Severity: Low]

A syzbot-reported KCSAN race is being fixed here, but the trailer block has
only Reported-by: and Closes: and no Fixes: tag.

The commit message does already explain the reasoning:

    This is not a stable candidate on its own: it depends on the
    connection reference counting introduced by the preceding patches,
    and the race it closes needs a connection destroyed under a live
    socket, which takes netns teardown, module unload or device removal.

Is that intended to stand in for the missing Fixes: tag, or would a Fixes:
plus an explicit "not for stable" note be preferred here?

[Severity: Low]

The kerneldoc-style comment on c_destroy_in_prog in struct rds_connection
says the flag is "read through rds_destroy_pending()", but three new sites
here read the raw flag instead:

	conn = rcu_dereference(parent->c_passive);
	if (conn && READ_ONCE(conn->c_destroy_in_prog))

	if (READ_ONCE(parent->c_destroy_in_prog)) {

	if (READ_ONCE(passive->c_destroy_in_prog)) {

The distinction looks deliberate, since rds_destroy_pending() also reports
netns teardown and module unload, which these sites do not want.

Could the comment in rds.h be updated to describe the narrower "this conn's
destroy has begun" read, so a later reader does not convert these sites to
the helper?

[Severity: High]

This isn't a bug introduced by this patch - baseline 8830e65 has the same
mismatch - but since the series rewrites these teardown functions, is the
npaths derivation here still correct for loopback-converted connections?

__rds_conn_create() computes npaths from the transport the caller passed in,
before it may switch trans:

	int npaths = (trans->t_mp_capable ? RDS_MPATH_WORKERS : 1);
	...
			trans = &rds_loop_transport;
	...
	conn->c_trans = trans;
	for (i = 0; i < npaths; i++) {
		...
		conn->c_path[i].cp_wq = alloc_ordered_workqueue(...);

For an outgoing RDS/TCP send to a local address, rds_tcp_transport has both
t_mp_capable and t_prefer_loopback set, so npaths is RDS_MPATH_WORKERS and
8 ordered workqueues are allocated, but c_trans ends up as
rds_loop_transport, whose t_mp_capable is 0.

rds_conn_destroy() and rds_conn_destroy_fini() then recompute npaths from
conn->c_trans and get 1, so only path 0 is quiesced and freed before
kfree(conn->c_path) drops the pointers to the other 7 workqueues.

rds_conn_path_free() also returns early for paths without transport data:

	if (!cp->cp_transport_data)
		return;

	if (cp->cp_wq != rds_wq) {
		destroy_workqueue(cp->cp_wq);

and rds_loop_conn_alloc() only populates path 0 (c_transport_data is a macro
for c_path[0].cp_transport_data), so even a corrected npaths would still skip
destroy_workqueue() for paths 1..7.

Can this leak 7 workqueues per loopback TCP connection, repeatable via
create netns / send to 127.0.0.1 / exit netns?

Note the rollback path in __rds_conn_create() uses the local, pre-switch
npaths and no transport-data gate:

		for (i = 0; i < npaths; i++)
			if (free_cp[i].cp_wq != rds_wq)
				destroy_workqueue(free_cp[i].cp_wq);

which suggests the two derivations are not interchangeable.

[Severity: Low]

The new text says rs_conn "is read and written under rs_lock", and
rds_ioctl(SIOCRDSSETTOS/SIOCRDSGETTOS) now relies on that. But rds_release()
in net/rds/af_rds.c reads it, puts it and stores NULL with no lock held:

	if (rs->rs_conn) {
		rds_conn_put(rs->rs_conn);
		rs->rs_conn = NULL;
	}

That looks safe today because rds_release() runs after the last fd reference
is gone, so no concurrent rds_sendmsg()/rds_ioctl() is possible. Could the
comment note that release-time exception?

Related: rs_tos is now read and written under rs_lock by both ioctls and read
under rs_lock by rds_sendmsg(), yet the "rs_lock protects all these adjacent
members before the newline" comment below only spans rs_send_queue through
rs_notify_queue. Should rs_tos (and rs_conn) be listed as rs_lock-protected
there?

[Severity: Medium]

Does the code actually drop the destroy-pending connection from the cache?

The commit message says "sendmsg drops it and looks up or creates a live
one", and the comment above says "dropping it here lets the next sendmsg look
up or create a live one". But when rds_destroy_pending(conn) is true, only
the local variable is cleared:

	conn = rs->rs_conn;
	if (conn && ... && !rds_destroy_pending(conn)) {
		rds_conn_get(conn);
	} else {
		conn = NULL;
	}

rs->rs_conn still points at the quiesced connection and still owns the
reference this patch gave it. The cache is only replaced further down, after
a successful create and a passing ToS re-check:

	rds_conn_get(conn);
	old = rs->rs_conn;
	rs->rs_conn = conn;
	spin_unlock_irqrestore(&rs->rs_lock, flags);
	if (old)
		rds_conn_put(old);

So if rds_conn_create_outgoing() fails with -ENOMEM, or the ToS re-check
returns -EAGAIN, or the socket simply never sends again after an IB device
removal quiesced the connection, doesn't the destroyed conn stay pinned by
rs->rs_conn until rds_release()?

That would keep the conn slab object, its c_path array, its per-path ordered
workqueues, the transport per-connection state and the elevated
trans->t_conn_count alive for the socket's lifetime.

Would clearing rs->rs_conn and calling rds_conn_put() on it right where
rds_destroy_pending() is observed, still under rs_lock, match the described
behaviour?

[Severity: Low]

This read of rs->rs_tos is a plain access with no lock held, while
rds_ioctl(SIOCRDSSETTOS) does a plain store under rs_lock:

	spin_lock_irqsave(&rs->rs_lock, flags);
	if (rs->rs_tos || rs->rs_conn) {
		spin_unlock_irqrestore(&rs->rs_lock, flags);
		return -EINVAL;
	}
	rs->rs_tos = tos;

On a first send, rs_conn is NULL, so the ioctl does not refuse the change and
both accesses can run concurrently. Isn't that still a KCSAN-reportable data
race on rs_tos, in a patch whose purpose is removing such a race on the
adjacent rs_conn?

The locked re-check below keeps a stale-ToS connection from being installed
or used, so the effect looks limited to the report itself. Would taking the
rs_tos snapshot under rs_lock (or with READ_ONCE()) and keeping the re-check
close it?
