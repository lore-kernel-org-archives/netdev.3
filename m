Subject: [PATCH net-next 4/4] net/rds: acquire RDS_IN_XMIT in rds_tcp_reset_callbacks()

rds_tcp_reset_callbacks() quiesces the transmit path by setting the
path state to RDS_CONN_RESETTING and then waiting for RDS_IN_XMIT to
be sampled clear before swapping the underlying socket and calling
rds_send_path_reset().

As in rds_conn_shutdown(), sampling the bit clear is not the same as
owning it: rds_send_xmit() can re-acquire RDS_IN_XMIT right after the
wait_event() returns.  Its state recheck after taking the lock is a
store-buffering pattern (teardown writes the state and reads the bit,
the sender writes the bit and reads the state) and acquire_in_xmit()
is only an acquire operation, so on weakly ordered architectures both
sides can miss each other's write and the transmit path then runs
concurrently with rds_send_path_reset() rewriting cp_xmit_* state.

Take the lock instead, hold it across the socket swap and
rds_send_path_reset(), and release it with a wake-up at the end.  The
lock-ordering constraint documented above the wait still holds: the
lock is acquired before lock_sock(), so a sender inside tcp_sendmsg()
can never be waited on while we hold the socket lock.

Owning the lock also serializes this function against
rds_conn_shutdown(), which since the previous patch holds RDS_IN_XMIT
across the transport shutdown.  That closes two holes the old
sample-based wait left open when a teardown and a duelling-SYN accept
raced on the same path:

 - t_sock is now read only after the lock is acquired.  The old code
   cached it before waiting; a concurrent teardown could release that
   socket inside rds_tcp_conn_path_shutdown() while the accept path
   was still blocked, which would leave it locking and releasing a
   freed socket once it resumed.

 - The old !osock early path called rds_send_path_reset() with no
   serialization at all, while the teardown could be running
   rds_send_path_reset() on the same path concurrently.  Losing that
   race means two threads walking cp_send_queue and putting the same
   messages.  That path now also runs under the lock (and sets
   RDS_CONN_RESETTING like the normal path; the raced connection ends
   up dropped and reconnecting either way).

The in-function comment describing the old wait-based quiesce is
rewritten to describe the lock-based one.

Previously patch 4/4 of "net/rds: Bug fix ports, part 2".
v2: read t_sock only after acquiring RDS_IN_XMIT and hold the lock on
the !osock path too, closing the teardown-vs-accept races described
in the commit message; rewrite the in-function quiesce comment.
