net/rds: hold connection references in lookup, sockets and c_passive

This patch hands out real references wherever a struct rds_connection
pointer previously escaped bare: rds_conn_lookup() and __rds_conn_create()
return a referenced connection, the rs->rs_conn sendmsg cache owns a
reference and is read/written under rs_lock, and parent->c_passive owns an
RCU-annotated reference.  Serializing the rs_conn cache also resolves a
syzbot-reported KCSAN data race between concurrent rds_sendmsg() calls.

Closes: https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=879c1877016972360186

A few questions on the commit message and on the new reference handling.

[Severity: Medium]

The commit message says:

  The connection may still be destroyed while a send is in flight -
  when its device is removed or its netns is torn down - but it is
  only quiesced; the free is held off by the sender's reference.

and later:

  the race it closes needs a connection destroyed under a live
  socket, which takes netns teardown, module unload or device removal.

Are either of the two named triggers reachable at this commit?

For device removal, rds_ib_remove_one() only calls rds_ib_dev_shutdown(),
which drops paths rather than destroying connections:

net/rds/ib.c:rds_ib_dev_shutdown() {
	...
	list_for_each_entry(ic, &rds_ibdev->conn_list, ib_node)
		rds_conn_path_drop(&ic->conn->c_path[0], true);
}

The only IB caller of rds_conn_destroy() is rds_ib_destroy_nodev_conns()
from rds_ib_exit(), i.e. module unload.

For netns teardown, rds_tcp_kill_sock() and rds_loop_kill_conns() run from
pernet ->exit hooks, which only run once the netns refcount reaches zero,
and a userspace RDS socket holds a netns reference from sk_alloc().
rds_sendmsg() also only ever caches a conn whose c_net matches the
socket's netns, given rds_conn_create_outgoing(sock_net(sock->sk), ...)
and the net == rds_conn_net(conn) test in rds_conn_lookup().

Module unload is blocked for as long as a bound socket exists:

net/rds/transport.c:rds_trans_get_preferred() {
	if (trans && (trans->laddr_check(net, addr, scope_id) == 0) &&
	    (!trans->t_owner || try_module_get(trans->t_owner))) {

and that module reference is released only by rds_trans_put() in
rds_release().

Would it be more accurate to describe what is fixed here as the KCSAN data
race on the plain rs->rs_conn stores plus the -EAGAIN-forever behaviour
against a quiesced cached conn, rather than a free under a sender?

[Severity: Medium]

This is a pre-existing issue and not introduced by this patch, but the
patch does make it an explicitly supported state for rds_sendmsg() to keep
running on a connection whose rds_conn_destroy() is in progress ("it is
only quiesced; the free is held off by the sender's reference").

Is the quiesce synchronized against a sender that is already past this
rds_destroy_pending() test?

rds_conn_path_quiesce() walks and unlinks cp_send_queue with no cp_lock
held, and BUG_ON()s on any message a socket still has linked:

net/rds/connection.c:rds_conn_path_quiesce() {
	/* tear down queued messages */
	list_for_each_entry_safe(rm, rtmp,
				 &cp->cp_send_queue,
				 m_conn_item) {
		list_del_init(&rm->m_conn_item);
		BUG_ON(!list_empty(&rm->m_sock_item));

Meanwhile rds_sendmsg() tests rds_destroy_pending(conn) once and can then
block for an unbounded time in rds_cong_wait() and in the
wait_event_interruptible_timeout() retry loop before rds_send_queue_rm()
inserts the message under cp_lock, with no re-test at insertion.

The unlocked traversal is addressed later in the same series by "net/rds:
take cp_lock to purge cp_send_queue in the quiesce", which splices the
queue under cp_lock.  The remaining window - a message landing on
cp_send_queue after the purge - still needs a destroy running under a live
sender, which does not look reachable at this commit for the reasons above.

[Severity: Medium]

Can either of these puts (or the rds_conn_put(old) in the install path
above) be the final reference while a message that this same call queued is
still linked on cp->cp_send_queue?

At this commit rds_send_queue_rm() stores the connection and path pointers
into the message but takes only a message reference:

net/rds/send.c:rds_send_queue_rm() {
	...
		rds_message_populate_header(&rm->m_inc.i_hdr, sport, dport, 0);
		rm->m_inc.i_conn = conn;
		rm->m_inc.i_conn_path = cp;
		rds_message_addref(rm);

and the socket side later dereferences both:

net/rds/send.c:rds_send_drop_to() {
		conn = rm->m_inc.i_conn;
		if (conn->c_trans->t_mp_capable)
			cp = rm->m_inc.i_conn_path;
		else
			cp = &conn->c_path[0];

		spin_lock_irqsave(&cp->cp_lock, flags);

after rds_conn_destroy_fini() has done kfree(conn->c_path) and
kmem_cache_free(rds_conn_slab, conn).

A later patch in this series, "net/rds: hold a connection reference from
struct rds_incoming" (fe1de9d527be), adds rds_conn_get(conn) in
rds_send_queue_rm() immediately before the i_conn store, released from
rds_message_put(), which closes this gap.  Hitting it at this commit also
requires rds_conn_destroy() to run while a socket still has a message
queued on that connection, which does not look reachable here.

Would it make sense to order the rds_incoming reference patch ahead of this
one, or to note the dependency in the commit message?

[Severity: Low]

The comment credits rds_tcp_listen_stop() with clearing the listen socket,
but that helper is handed the socket by value and never touches
rtn->rds_tcp_listen_sock:

net/rds/tcp_listen.c:rds_tcp_listen_stop() {
	...
	flush_workqueue(rds_wq);
	flush_work(acceptor);
	sock_release(sock);
}

The pointer is cleared by the caller, just before it calls the helper:

net/rds/tcp.c:rds_tcp_kill_sock() {
	...
	rtn->rds_tcp_listen_sock = NULL;
	rds_tcp_listen_stop(lsock, &rtn->rds_tcp_accept_w);

The clear-then-flush-then-destroy ordering the safety argument relies on
does hold, but it comes from rds_tcp_kill_sock().  Could the comment name
that function instead?
