net: mana: give each HWC message slot its own completion state

This commit adds a per-slot spinlock to hwc_caller_ctx. The lock protects
output_buf, error and status_code. The commit also reinitializes the
completion and result state when a slot is acquired, and adds a
channel-wide hwc_timed_out latch that rejects new requests after a genuine
timeout. Status handling and request cleanup are split into helpers.

[Severity: Medium]
After one genuine timeout, mana_hwc_send_request() calls
mana_hwc_finish_request(hwc, ctx, msg_id, true). That sets
hwc->hwc_timed_out in mana_hwc_put_msg_index(). Nothing clears the flag
until the hwc is freed and mana_hwc_create_channel() allocates a new one.

After that point, does every mana_hwc_get_msg_index() call return
-ETIMEDOUT without posting anything to the SQ? That would include teardown
commands.

For example, mana_gd_destroy_queue() ignores the result of the destroy
command and frees the host memory anyway:

drivers/net/ethernet/microsoft/mana/gdma_main.c:mana_gd_destroy_queue() {
    ...
	mana_gd_destroy_dma_region(gc, gmi->dma_region_handle);
	mana_gd_free_memory(gmi);
	kfree(queue);
}

If the device was only slow and not dead, could it keep a DMA region
mapping that points at freed host pages?

mana_serv_reset() in gdma_pci.c does this:

	/* HWC is not responding in this case, so don't wait */
	hwc->hwc_timeout = 0;

With a zero timeout, the first suspend command now latches the channel,
so the rest of the suspend-time destroy commands are never posted. Before
this patch they were posted.

The firmware HWC_DATA_CFG_HWC_TIMEOUT update in
mana_hwc_init_event_handler() changes hwc_timeout but cannot clear the
latch. Runtime timeout users such as mana_gf_stats_work_handler() will
also see later commands fail without being sent until the reset runs.

The next patch in the series, "net: mana: support concurrent HWC
requests", removes hwc_timed_out. It replaces the latch with per-slot
quarantine, which a late response or teardown releases. So this only
affects this intermediate commit, either during bisection or if this
patch is backported alone.

Could this commit avoid the channel-wide latch so that every commit in the
series is bisect-safe?

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug in the new code. These changes, together with the
output_buf handling under ctx->lock, fix problems that exist in the
baseline driver, but the commit has no Fixes: tag and no Cc: stable.

In the baseline, the bootstrap channel has depth one, so every request
uses msg_id 0. Three problems follow from that.

First, mana_hwc_get_msg_index() never called reinit_completion(). A late
complete() for a request that had already timed out left comp_event done.
The next wait_for_completion_timeout() then returned at once, with stale
error and status_code values and a response buffer that was never filled.

Second, mana_hwc_handle_resp() only checked test_bit(msg_id) before
memcpy(ctx->output_buf, ...). There is a window between bitmap_set() in
mana_hwc_get_msg_index() and this assignment in mana_hwc_send_request():

	ctx->output_buf = resp;

A stale response arriving in that window could pass the check and copy
into the previous caller's output_buf. That buffer is often on the stack,
such as the resp in mana_gd_query_hwc_timeout(), and that function has
already returned.

Third, a late response arriving after the next request had set its bit
and output_buf would be accepted as the answer to that request.

The commit message does say "A late response therefore cannot copy through
a pointer to caller storage whose lifetime has ended". Without a Fixes:
tag, though, stable trees won't pick this up. A plain backport of this
patch would also carry the hwc_timed_out latch that the next patch
removes.

Would it make sense to send a self-contained fix for these, with a Fixes:
tag, to net separately?
