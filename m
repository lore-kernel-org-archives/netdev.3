net/rds: wait for connections to be freed on transport unload

This adds a per-transport live connection count (t_conn_count), bumped when
a connection is published in __rds_conn_create() and dropped as the last
step of rds_conn_destroy_fini().  A new helper,
rds_conn_wait_conns_freed(), polls that count so rds_ib_exit(),
rds_tcp_exit() and rds_loop_exit() do not unload while a connection free is
still pending, with an optional resweep callback for IB's asynchronous
device detach.

A few questions below about the resweep callback, the unbounded wait, and
where the wake happens.

[Severity: Medium]

Is it safe for this wake to happen from inside transport module text?

The final rds_conn_put() is not always made by the unloading thread.
rds_ib_connect_complete() in net/rds/ib_cm.c calls rds_conn_destroy() when
the peer negotiated an unsupported protocol version, and later in the series
rds_rdma_cm_event_handler_cmn() drops its own connection reference in its
out: epilogue.  Both of those run in rds_rdma.ko text:

RDMA_CM_EVENT_ESTABLISHED
  rds_rdma_cm_event_handler_cmn()
    rds_ib_connect_complete()
      rds_conn_destroy()
        rds_conn_put()
          rds_conn_destroy_fini()
            atomic_dec_return(&trans->t_conn_count) == 0
            wake_up_all(&rds_conn_freed_waitq)

If that put is the last one, the rmmod thread parked in
rds_conn_wait_conns_freed() is released while the releasing thread is still
executing and returning through rds_rdma text (at this commit it still has a
mutex_unlock(&conn->c_cm_lock) to do).  Nothing appears to keep that thread
out of the module image, so can rds_ib_exit() finish and free_module()
unmap the text under the frame that is still unwinding?

Is a quiesce of the transport's own asynchronous contexts needed after the
count reaches zero, so the last decrement is guaranteed to be the last
transport instruction executed?

[Severity: Low]

This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but the comment describes a
property the tree does not have yet at this commit.  It says "an unread
datagram pins the inc that carries it, and thus the connection", and that
the frees covered by the wait include inc_free and the transport's slabs.

At this commit t_conn_count counts connections only, and no inc holds a
connection reference, so an outstanding inc does not keep the predicate
false.  rds_ib_exit() can therefore return from the wait and go on to
rds_ib_recv_exit(), which only warns before destroying the slabs:

net/rds/ib_recv.c:rds_ib_recv_exit() {
	WARN_ON(atomic_read(&rds_ib_allocation));

	kmem_cache_destroy(rds_ib_incoming_slab);
	kmem_cache_destroy(rds_ib_frag_slab);
}

The later patch "net/rds: hold a connection reference from struct
rds_incoming" adds rds_conn_get() to rds_inc_init()/rds_inc_path_init(),
which is what makes the comment true, so this is only a matter of the
comment running ahead of the code.  Would it read better with the inc part
moved to that patch?

[Severity: Medium]

wait_event_timeout() sleeps in TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE, and this loop has no
bound, no kill/signal check and no error return, so the only way out is
t_conn_count reaching zero.

The callers are module exit functions, reached after try_stop_module() has
already set MODULE_STATE_GOING:

delete_module()
  mod->exit()
    rds_tcp_exit()  -> rds_conn_wait_conns_freed(&rds_tcp_transport, NULL)
    rds_ib_exit()   -> rds_conn_wait_conns_freed(&rds_ib_transport, ...)
    rds_loop_exit() -> rds_conn_wait_conns_freed(&rds_loop_transport, NULL)

As the commit message itself notes, the count can be held up by an
unprivileged local process that simply leaves a datagram unread, on a socket
that may belong to a different transport and therefore pins no module
reference:

    "an unread datagram pins its connection for as long as the application
     leaves it on the receive queue, and rds_find_bound() does not filter
     on transport, so that socket may well belong to a different transport
     than the connection and pin nothing that stops this unload"

In that case the rmmod thread stays in unkillable D state, the remaining
exit steps (rds_trans_unregister(), rds_tcp_recv_exit(), rds_ib_mr_exit())
never run, the module cannot be reloaded because try_module_get() fails on a
GOING module, and the new pr_warn() repeats every ten seconds for as long as
the machine is up.  For rds_loop_exit() the module in question is the core
rds module.

Since trans->t_owner is already used with try_module_get()/module_put() in
rds_trans_get()/rds_trans_get_preferred(), would holding a module reference
per live connection or inc be preferable, so delete_module() fails with
-EBUSY instead of blocking forever?  Failing that, could the wait at least
be killable or freezer aware?

[Severity: High]

Is rds_ib_destroy_nodev_conns() safe to call more than once?  It moves the
global list with a plain list_splice() and never re-initialises the head:

net/rds/ib_rdma.c:rds_ib_destroy_nodev_conns() {
	/* avoid calling conn_destroy with irqs off */
	spin_lock_irq(&ib_nodev_conns_lock);
	list_splice(&ib_nodev_conns, &tmp_list);
	spin_unlock_irq(&ib_nodev_conns_lock);

	list_for_each_entry_safe(ic, _ic, &tmp_list, ib_node)
		rds_conn_destroy(ic->conn);
}

rds_loop_exit() in the same tree does the reset that is missing here:

	spin_lock_irq(&loop_conns_lock);
	list_splice(&loop_conns, &tmp_list);
	INIT_LIST_HEAD(&loop_conns);
	spin_unlock_irq(&loop_conns_lock);

After the first non-empty sweep, ib_nodev_conns.next and .prev still point
at entries that now live on the previous sweep's stack-local tmp_list, and
those rds_ib_connection objects are freed asynchronously by
rds_ib_conn_free() when the last connection reference goes away.

The resweep runs on every 100 ms poll for as long as t_conn_count is
non-zero, so a second call is the expected case here.  On that call
list_empty(&ib_nodev_conns) is false, so list_splice() writes through
first->prev and last->next into rds_ib_connection memory that may already be
kfree()d, and the walk then follows a chain whose tail points at the tmp_list
of a stack frame that has already returned.  Can this corrupt memory?

In the other direction, rds_ib_conn_free() does:

net/rds/ib_cm.c:rds_ib_conn_free() {
	spin_lock_irq(lock_ptr);
	list_del(&ic->ib_node);
	spin_unlock_irq(lock_ptr);

with ib_node.prev being the address of the returned sweep's stack frame,
which is the region rds_conn_wait_conns_freed() and the next sweep are now
using.

And a genuinely late migration does:

net/rds/ib_rdma.c:rds_ib_remove_conn() {
	list_add_tail(&ic->ib_node, &ib_nodev_conns);

which links through the stale head->prev, so the new entry can end up off
the chain reachable from head->next.  Would the resweep then never find it,
leaving the unbounded wait above running forever - the exact case the
resweep was added for?

Would list_splice_init() (or an INIT_LIST_HEAD() after the splice, as
rds_loop_exit() does) address this?

As an additional note, the later series patch "net/rds: unlink transport
nodes before a possibly deferred connection free" adds a per-entry
list_del_init() to this loop, which removes the stack-linkage part, but
ib_nodev_conns is still left pointing at the moved entries.  The second
sweep then re-splices self-linked detached nodes, where
tmp_list.next == &C->ib_node and C->ib_node.next == &C->ib_node, so does
list_for_each_entry_safe() loop on the same entry indefinitely, calling
rds_conn_destroy() on it each time?
