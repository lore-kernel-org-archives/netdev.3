Can we not?  It's already hard enough to zeroize keys and data at the
normal end of their lifetime in the kernel: that's something that is
always a struggle, with fix patches regularly going by for many years
and many subsystems never fixed at all.  If we can barely even do that,
we aren't going to be able to correctly and completely implement and
maintain separate zeroization code for every kernel subsystem that runs
only on kernel panics and has special constraints, like not being able
to take locks.

This is never going to be done either, with the scope always wanting to
grow to include other keys and data.  You may think this series covers
"almost everything" but it's actually not even close.

Could you perhaps narrow the scope to one or two things that actually
are useful and can reasonably be supported for the application?  For
example, secretmem seems to be the only thing you mentioned that you're
actually planning to use.
