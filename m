No, it does not cover that case. A link-local destination must not be
forwareded which the fe80::/64 trap rule takes care of. But a link-local
gateway must be resolved, because its MAC is what a nexthop egresses with.
Skipping the neighbour entirely satisfies the first and breaks the second.

It is right, nothing else writes entry->hwaddr, so it stays zero and the ne=
xthop
is trapped forever. I will fix this by sampling at init as mlxsw does, afte=
r the
nexthop is linked into neigh_entry->nexthop_list, so the update
reaches the nexthop that just attached.

>=20

Yes, it can. I will record the outcome rather than key on vrule_id_valid,
because that flag is not a reliable proxy any more. A link-local neighbour
now deliberately has no host route, so vrule_id_valid stays false for it
and the skip would never trigger. Recording the state enables the next
event to drive the retry.

>=20

No, it should not. In v3 I will only commit an address when told it is vali=
d.
And sparx5_rr_nexthop_egress_derive() no longer treats a non-zero hwaddr as
proof of resolution, not emits an address when it has decided the nexthop i=
s
trapped.

Sure, I will change this to NOTIFY_DONE.
