net/rds: unlink transport nodes before a possibly deferred connection free

The transport teardown helpers now unlink each per-connection transport node
under the transport lock right before calling rds_conn_destroy(), instead of
leaving that to the transport's conn_free().  The gather step also takes a
reference on each connection it moves onto the stack list and drops it after
the destroy, and the IB list movers no longer assert that a node is linked.

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but should the comment just above the lock selection in
rds_ib_conn_free() be updated too?  It still reads:

	/*
	 * Conn is either on a dev's list or on the nodev list.
	 * A race with shutdown() or connect() would cause problems
	 * (since rds_ibdev would change) but that should never happen.
	 ...
	lock_ptr = ic->rds_ibdev ? &ic->rds_ibdev->spinlock : &ib_nodev_conns_lock;

After this patch "on neither list" is a normal state, which is exactly what
the new list_empty() guard below handles.  rds_ib_add_conn() can now set
ic->rds_ibdev and take a device reference without linking ic->ib_node onto
rds_ibdev->conn_list, and rds_ib_remove_conn() can clear ic->rds_ibdev
without putting the node back on ib_nodev_conns.

The comment also still denies the connect/shutdown race that the new
comments in rds_ib_add_conn() and rds_ib_remove_conn() say can happen.

[Severity: High]
Can a concurrent rds_ib_add_conn() steal an entry out of the tmp_list that
rds_ib_destroy_nodev_conns() keeps on its own stack?

The gather in rds_ib_destroy_nodev_conns() leaves each node linked, just on
a different list head:

	list_for_each_entry_safe(ic, _ic, &ib_nodev_conns, ib_node) {
		if (rds_conn_get_unless_zero(ic->conn))
			list_move_tail(&ic->ib_node, &tmp_list);
	}

The new "has a sweep already claimed me" test in rds_ib_add_conn() is
list_empty(&ic->ib_node), which is false for a node parked on tmp_list:

	spin_lock_irq(&ib_nodev_conns_lock);
	if (!list_empty(&ic->ib_node)) {
		list_del(&ic->ib_node);

		spin_lock(&rds_ibdev->spinlock);
		list_add_tail(&ic->ib_node, &rds_ibdev->conn_list);
		spin_unlock(&rds_ibdev->spinlock);
	}

So rds_ib_setup_qp()->rds_ib_add_conn() from the RDMA-CM event path would
treat a gathered node as still being on ib_nodev_conns and move it onto
rds_ibdev->conn_list.  rds_ib_remove_conn() does the mirror image, unlinking
a gathered node while holding only rds_ibdev->spinlock and re-adding it to
ib_nodev_conns.

The second loop in rds_ib_destroy_nodev_conns() walks tmp_list without
ib_nodev_conns_lock, and each iteration is long, since rds_conn_destroy()
does synchronize_rcu() plus work cancel/flush.  If the entry the iterator
is about to follow has been moved, doesn't the walk continue onto
rds_ibdev->conn_list or ib_nodev_conns?

That walk would then call rds_conn_destroy() and rds_conn_put() on
connections for which the gather never took a reference, and the loop's
termination test pos == &tmp_list can no longer fire on the foreign chain,
so the conn_list head embedded in struct rds_ib_device is eventually treated
as a struct rds_ib_connection and ic->conn read from it.

The list_del_init(&ic->ib_node) in that loop is also done under
ib_nodev_conns_lock, while a stolen node now lives on rds_ibdev->conn_list,
which is protected by rds_ibdev->spinlock and walked concurrently by
rds_ib_dev_shutdown().

And if a stolen entry is never reached by the walk, the reference the gather
took on it is never dropped, so does the resweep loop in rds_ib_exit():

	rds_ib_destroy_nodev_conns();
	rds_conn_wait_conns_freed(&rds_ib_transport,
				  rds_ib_destroy_nodev_conns);

keep spinning with "still waiting for N connection(s) to be freed before
unload" because t_conn_count never reaches zero?

The commit message says "a connect or shutdown worker can still be running
for a connection the sweep has just unlinked", and the gathered window is
earlier and longer than the unlinked one the guard was written for.  TCP
records this state explicitly with tc->t_tcp_node_detached; would IB need an
equivalent recorded under the transport lock at gather time, rather than
relying on list_empty()?
