From: Ilia Levi <ilia.levi@intel.com>

Everything so far reports topology that a provider composed. Composing it
from userspace needs the core to create an empty fabric, move an endpoint
into or out of one, change administrative state and record a peer. None of
that may leave the object model half-updated.

Add the core mechanisms without exposing provisioning netlink operations.
Deleting a provider-owned or non-empty fabric is refused.

Provider callbacks may sleep and therefore run without drm_fabric_lock.
drm_fabric_mutation_lock serialises validation, the provider callback and
the core update, with targets pinned across the unlocked callback.
Registration and teardown join the same transaction domain, so a successful
callback cannot be invalidated before commit.

Administrative intent stays separate from operational state, and each port
selects one peer writer at registration. A request that already matches
committed state succeeds without invoking the provider.

Registering an orphan endpoint is now valid, so the KUnit case asserting
that a NULL fabric is rejected is repurposed to assert that it yields an
orphan reporting fabric-id 0.

 Objects are reference counted and a port is pinned through its owning endpoint.
 Endpoint unregister drops the registration reference and waits for outstanding
 pins before freeing the ports; fabric membership holds a fabric reference.

+Provider lifecycle operations that can invalidate a prepared mutation take the

+unregister. A provider-driven teardown therefore cannot race an in-flight
+mutation on the same object, and a registration cannot claim a fabric-scoped
+``fabric-ep-id`` after an attach has validated the identifier but before its
+provider callback completes. A provider must not invoke any of these lifecycle
+operations from one of its own mutation callbacks: the callback already holds
+the mutation lock, so the nested acquisition would self-deadlock. A successful
+callback therefore cannot be invalidated before commit, and the post-callback
+checks are invariant assertions only.
+
+A fabric records whether it was created by a provider or by userspace. Only an
+empty userspace-created fabric may be deleted through the provisioning core;
+provider-owned and non-empty fabrics are rejected.
