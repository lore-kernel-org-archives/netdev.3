net: bridge: fdb: hold hash_lock when an entry roams

With this patch, br_fdb_update() takes br->hash_lock when an existing
entry roams to a new port or its flags change. The switchdev delete and
add notifications for the roam are then sent under that lock. The common
case, where the entry neither roams nor changes, stays lockless.

[Severity: High]
Is fdb still in the table by the time hash_lock is taken here?

The entry was found with fdb_find_rcu() before the lock was taken. In
that window, any hash_lock holder can run fdb_delete() on it:

net/bridge/br_fdb.c:fdb_delete() {
    ...
	hlist_del_init_rcu(&f->fdb_node);
	rhashtable_remove_fast(&br->fdb_hash_tbl, &f->rhnode,
			       br_fdb_rht_params);
    ...
	fdb_notify(br, f, RTM_DELNEIGH, swdev_notify);
	kfree_rcu(f, rcu);
}

fdb_delete() does not touch fdb->dst. So when this CPU gets the lock,
source != fdb->dst is still true and the following happens:

- a second switchdev RTM_DELNEIGH goes out for the old port
- fdb->dst is rewritten
- a switchdev add and a netlink RTM_NEWNEIGH go out for the new port

At that point the entry is in neither fdb_list nor the rhashtable, so
nothing will ever send the matching delete. The next frame from that MAC
then goes through fdb_create() and sends another add.

Isn't this the same "two deletions for one addition" imbalance the commit
message describes, with the DSA CPU port host address refcount leaking?

Possible deleters include br_fdb_delete_by_port() (port disable or
removal), br_fdb_cleanup() (ageing and STP fast ageing), br_fdb_flush(),
and user or external-learn deletes. br_fdb_delete_by_port() holds
hash_lock for its whole walk. A roaming CPU spinning on the lock would
only get it after the entry has already been removed.

Other code in this file that finds an entry locklessly re-checks it after
taking the lock. For example, br_fdb_cleanup():

			spin_lock_bh(&br->hash_lock);
			if (!hlist_unhashed(&f->fdb_node))
				fdb_delete(br, f, true);
			spin_unlock_bh(&br->hash_lock);

Would a similar check right after spin_lock() be needed here?

	if (unlikely(hlist_unhashed(&fdb->fdb_node))) {
		spin_unlock(&br->hash_lock);
		return;
	}

[Severity: Medium]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but br_fdb_update() tests
BR_FDB_LOCAL before taking the lock and does not test it again inside the
new hash_lock section:

		if (unlikely(test_bit(BR_FDB_LOCAL, &fdb->flags))) {

A concurrent "bridge fdb replace ... permanent" runs fdb_add_entry() under
hash_lock. In that window it can set the local and static bits on the
entry:

		if (state & NUD_PERMANENT) {
			set_bit(BR_FDB_LOCAL, &fdb->flags);
			if (!test_and_set_bit(BR_FDB_STATIC, &fdb->flags))
				fdb_add_hw_addr(br, addr);

Could the roam then move a newly permanent entry onto the receiving port?
Since the lock is now held here anyway, could BR_FDB_LOCAL be re-checked
under it?

The impact looks limited. The switchdev notifications stay balanced
because both target br->dev for local entries, and frames to a local
entry are still delivered locally. Hitting this needs CAP_NET_ADMIN and
the right timing.

[Severity: High]
This is a pre-existing issue, but can this roam move an entry onto a
locked MAB port and leave it unlocked?

br_handle_frame_finish() decides about the locked port from a lockless
lookup. On a mismatch it drops "without roaming":

net/bridge/br_input.c:br_handle_frame_finish() {
    ...
		if (!fdb_src) {
			...
			if (test_bit(BR_PORT_MAB_BIT, &p->flags))
				br_fdb_update(br, p, eth_hdr(skb)->h_source,
					      vid, BIT(BR_FDB_LOCKED));
			goto drop;
		} else if (READ_ONCE(fdb_src->dst) != p ||
			   test_bit(BR_FDB_LOCAL, &fdb_src->flags)) {
			/* FDB mismatch. Drop the packet without roaming. */
			goto drop;
		} else if (test_bit(BR_FDB_LOCKED, &fdb_src->flags)) {
			...
			br_fdb_update(br, p, eth_hdr(skb)->h_source, vid,
				      BIT(BR_FDB_LOCKED));
			goto drop;
		}
    ...
}

br_fdb_update() then does the lookup again. On the existing-entry path it
ignores BIT(BR_FDB_LOCKED) in flags. It roams whenever source != fdb->dst
and BR_FDB_STICKY is clear, and it clears BR_FDB_LOCKED on the assumption
that it is "roaming to an unlocked port".

Two interleavings seem possible.

In the first, the lookup in br_handle_frame_finish() misses. Before
br_fdb_update() does its own lookup, a legitimate host on unlocked port q
creates the entry. The entry is then roamed onto locked port p with
BR_FDB_LOCKED cleared.

In the second, a locked entry for MAC M sits on p. The legitimate host on
q roams it to q, which clears BR_FDB_LOCKED. A concurrent frame on p has
already passed the dst == p && BR_FDB_LOCKED check. It calls
br_fdb_update(br, p, ..., BIT(BR_FDB_LOCKED)), sees dst == q, and roams
the entry back to p, unlocked.

In both cases, later frames from p with that source MAC pass the locked
port check and are forwarded. Traffic for M also goes to p until the
host roams the entry back.

The roam now runs under hash_lock. Would that be a good place to refuse
the roam when BIT(BR_FDB_LOCKED) is set in flags, or when the source port
is locked?

[Severity: Medium]
This isn't a bug introduced by this patch, but the other places that
change fdb->dst don't use the order this path uses: delete for the old
port, then add for the new one.

fdb_add_entry() does:

		if (READ_ONCE(fdb->dst) != source) {
			WRITE_ONCE(fdb->dst, source);
			modified = true;
		}

br_fdb_external_learn_add() does:

		if (READ_ONCE(fdb->dst) != p) {
			WRITE_ONCE(fdb->dst, p);
			modified = true;
		}

Afterwards both only call fdb_notify() with RTM_NEWNEIGH. Neither sends a
switchdev RTM_DELNEIGH for the old port.

Can a "bridge fdb replace" that moves a static or ext-learned entry
between a foreign port and a DSA user port unbalance the DSA CPU port
host address refcount in the same way? This needs CAP_NET_ADMIN, and it
is separate from the race this patch addresses.
