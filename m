Hi,

this RFC series lets a user or group id be a UUID (RFC 9562, version 4)
or a Microsoft GUID as well as a classic 32-bit number. Processes can run
as such a user, files can be owned by one, and credentials, ACLs, keys,
System V IPC, sockets, signals, audit and procfs carry the whole id.

Why
---
Directory services name users by 128-bit ids: Active Directory by
objectGUID (and SIDs), LDAP directories often by entryUUID. Today every
system that serves such users (winbind, sssd, nfsidmap, ksmbd user
space) maps them to 32-bit numbers through ranges, hashes or a local
database. The numbers differ between machines unless the mapping is
configured the same everywhere, mappings can collide, and ownership
written to shared storage or a backup depends on the machine that wrote
it. With the 128-bit id in the kernel, the id the directory hands out is
also the owner on disk and in every credential, and no mapping table is
needed.

Design
------
- kuid_t and kgid_t become a tagged union (legacy number, UUID, GUID)
  instead of a u32. There is no table that maps UUIDs to numbers: the
  kernel compares, hashes and stores the whole id. uid_eq(), uid_lt()
  and the other helpers keep their meaning. Patches 1-3 add the UAPI
  type and helpers. Patches 4-8 fix places that relied on kuid_t being
  a u32: sk_uid is now read through a seqcount, and af_unix, netlink and
  Bluetooth keep only classic ids in skb->cb. Patch 9 changes the type.

- UUIDs and GUIDs exist only in the initial user namespace. They are not
  part of any uid_map or gid_map, show as the overflow id in other
  namespaces, and no capability in a child namespace gives privilege
  over them. Idmapped mounts pass them through unchanged.

- The classic system calls keep their 32-bit ids and show a UUID or GUID
  as the overflow id, as the 16-bit calls do for ids above 65535. A new
  family, named after the old calls with an _r suffix (getuid_r,
  setresuid_r, setgroups_r, fchownat_r, ...), takes a 20-byte
  __kernel_uid_r_t:

	typedef struct __kernel_uid_r {
		__u32 type;	/* UID_R_NONE, _LEGACY, _UUID, _GUID */
		union {
			__u32 legacy;
			__u8 uuid[16];
			__u8 guid[16];
		};
	} __kernel_uid_r_t;

  It has the same layout on every ABI, so none of the calls needs a
  compat entry.

- Existing interfaces get _R variants where an id is in the ABI:
  STATX_UID_R/STATX_GID_R, SO_PEERCRED_R, SO_PEERGROUPS_R,
  SCM_CREDENTIALS_R, si_uid_r in siginfo (offset 96 in every layout),
  IPC_STAT_R/IPC_SET_R, KEYCTL_CHOWN_R, and version 3 of the POSIX ACL
  xattr. procfs, audit records, key descriptions and the RPCSEC_GSS
  upcall use a text form (decimal, UUID, or GUID in braces).

- A filesystem has to declare that it can store such owners
  (SB_I_UID_R). Everywhere else, chown and creating a file as such a
  user fail with EOVERFLOW, so a UUID never turns into a wrong number
  on disk. tmpfs, ramfs and devpts declare it, overlayfs does when its
  upper layer does, and ext4 does with a new read-only compatible
  feature, uid_r (patches 31, 32 and 34; 256-byte inodes). NFSv4 and
  ksmbd carry the ids as text or as SIDs (S-1-22-3/4/5/6-...).

- Things that can't carry a 128-bit id fail closed instead of mapping:
  quotas don't account such owners, AUTH_SYS sends the overflow id,
  unprivileged ublk devices are refused, and gssd versions that don't
  know uid_r= refuse the upcall.

Documentation/userspace-api/uid_r.rst (patches 35 and 41) describes the
whole ABI and its limitations.

Testing
-------
- tools/testing/selftests/uid_r (patch 36): 14/14 pass.
- A boot test suite (nolibc init on QEMU, ext4 images with and without
  uid_r): 88/88 pass, on a kernel with USER_NS, overlayfs, tmpfs, POSIX
  ACLs and audit enabled.
- End to end on a full distribution (FenrirOS: patched libc, e2fsprogs,
  OpenSSH, rsync, libarchive, a ksmbd and NFS server): UUID users log in
  over ssh, own files on ext4, and reach ksmbd and NFSv4 shares.
- The selftests and the boot test suite ran on the same series on top
  of v7.2.9 and v7.2.11. On v7.3-rc7, the series is built for x86_64
  (bzImage and modules, with USER_NS, audit, ecryptfs, fscrypt, quota,
  ublk, NFS, Bluetooth and the LSMs enabled) and boots in QEMU, where an
  integration test with a full user space passes 24/24: ssh sessions
  with a pty as UUID users, UUID owners on tmpfs and overlayfs, SMB
  logins of UUID users through ksmbd with S-1-22-3-... owner SIDs, and
  NFSv4 showing and setting UUID owners. ext4 uid_r was not part of it.
- The syscall tables of the other architectures are wired up (patch 22)
  but haven't been built.

The e2fsprogs changes (mke2fs/tune2fs -O uid_r, e2fsck, debugfs, ACL
conversion in libext2fs) will be sent to linux-ext4 separately.

Open questions
--------------
- Is a tagged union in kuid_t acceptable, or would you rather see the
  128-bit id kept beside a u32 kuid_t?
- The new calls copy the classic get/set*id() and chown() families
  one by one (20 entries). A single setid_r(which, ...) call would need
  fewer syscall numbers. Which do you prefer?
- Should the series be split per subsystem (core/uidgid, fs and VFS,
  net, ext4, nfsd/ksmbd) after this RFC?

Changes in v2:
- No code changes. v1 reached the lists only up to patch 11, the mail
  provider throttled the rest; this is the complete series, now sent
  from jan.koester@tuxist.de (author and Signed-off-by changed to it).
- Hunk offsets refreshed against v7.3-rc7, testing section updated.
- v1: https://lore.kernel.org/r/cover.1792346472.git.jan.koester@gmx.net

The series is based on v7.3-rc7. The syscall numbers (473-492 on most
architectures) are placeholders and will follow whatever is merged first.
