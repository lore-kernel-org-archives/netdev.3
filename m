Hello Ilya,

In case you feel like experimenting, I'm interested to know if this kernel
works better for you.  We have some tx-hang work-arounds for mtk7996, among
other things:

https://github.com/greearb/linux-ct-7.2

We have not tested on bpi-r4 anytime recently, however, and never used WED as far
as I am aware.

Thanks,
Ben
