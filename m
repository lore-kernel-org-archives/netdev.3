selftests: net: add multithread client support to iou-zcrx

This adds pthreads to the iou-zcrx client so several connections can be
made at once, and a new -t option to pick how many threads are used
(default 1).  The Makefile now links iou-zcrx against -lpthread.

A few questions about the new client code below.

[Severity: Medium]
This is a pre-existing issue and is not introduced by this patch, since the
code was only renamed from run_client() to client_worker() here, but can
client_worker() read past the end of payload[]?

payload is allocated with a fixed size in main():

	if (posix_memalign((void **)&payload, page_size, SEND_SIZE))

while the loop in client_worker() walks cfg_send_size bytes:

	ssize_t to_send = cfg_send_size;
	...
	while (to_send) {
		void *src = &payload[sent];

		chunk = min_t(ssize_t, cfg_payload_len, to_send);
		res = send(fd, src, chunk, 0);

and cfg_send_size comes straight from -z with no comparison against
SEND_SIZE:

		case 'z':
			cfg_send_size = strtoul(optarg, NULL, 0);

With -z larger than SEND_SIZE (512 * 4096), does &payload[sent] end up past
the allocation, and are those out-of-bounds bytes then handed to send()?
process_recvzc() looks to have the mirror-image indexing on
payload[ctx->received + i].  No in-tree caller currently passes such a
value (iou-zcrx.py uses -z 16384), and this patch only increases the number
of threads that would perform the same read.

[Severity: Medium]
Is squaring the thread count here intentional?  The changelog says:

    Introduce the -t option to control the number of threads (default 1)

and the usage string added by this patch says -t<num_threads>, but
total_conns is cfg_num_threads * cfg_num_threads and is then used as the
calloc() element count and as the bound of both the pthread_create() and
pthread_join() loops in run_client().

So -t 2 gives 4 threads and 4 connections, -t 4 gives 16, and -t 8 gives
64; only the default of 1 matches the documented meaning.  Each worker
opens its own socket, so thread stacks and file descriptors also grow
quadratically with a value the help text presents as a plain thread count.

There is no comment explaining the squaring, and the later server patch in
this series treats -t as a literal thread/queue count:

	ctxs = calloc(cfg_num_threads, sizeof(*ctxs));
	...
	pthread_barrier_init(&setup_done, NULL, cfg_num_threads + 1);

At the end of the series (4a6d87a68298) run_client() still has
total_conns = cfg_num_threads * cfg_num_threads and the usage string still
reads -t<num_threads>, so the two halves of the same option keep disagreeing.
Could the squaring be dropped, or the option documented as the per-side
value it actually is?

[Severity: Medium]
At this commit, can the server side of the same binary service more than
one of these connections?

run_server() builds a single struct thread_ctx and posts exactly one accept:

	add_accept(&ctx, fd);

and process_accept() aborts on the second completion:

	if (ctx->connfd)
		error(1, 0, "Unexpected second connection");

Verification also uses a single ctx->received cursor into the global
payload, which only tracks one stream.  With -t greater than 1, do the
extra connections sit in the backlog while the server exits on the first
stream's EOF, leaving the remaining client_worker() threads to fail in
send() or block until the server timeout?

The receive side gains multi-connection support in the next patch of this
series ("selftests: net: add multithread server support to iou-zcrx"),
where run_server() spawns cfg_num_threads workers, accepts until
accepted < total_conns, dispatches each connfd into ctxs[idx].connfds[],
and drops the "Unexpected second connection" abort.  Would it be worth
ordering the server patch first so the tree is never in a state where
-t > 1 cannot complete?

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but at this commit no case in iou-zcrx.py passes -t, so
the new pthread_create()/pthread_join() loops in run_client() only ever run
with the default cfg_num_threads == 1 and the multithreaded path is not
exercised by the shipped suite.  Coverage arrives later in the series: at
4a6d87a68298 test_zcrx builds both command lines with -t {cfg.num_threads},
and the rss_multiqueue variant sets cfg.num_threads = 2.

[Severity: Low]
This isn't a bug, but -t is stored with strtoul() into the signed int
cfg_num_threads with no non-zero or range check, and run_client() then
evaluates cfg_num_threads * cfg_num_threads in int arithmetic before using
it as a calloc() count and loop bound.

-t 0 and -t 65536 (65536 * 65536 wraps to 0 in int) both create no threads
and let the client exit successfully without sending anything, -t 4294967295
narrows to -1, values at or above 46341 overflow the signed multiplication,
and -t 1000 asks for a million threads.

Note the rest of the file parses its numeric options the same unvalidated
way (-p, -l, -q, -o, -z, -x), so a small sanity check on -t alone would
still be an improvement if the squaring stays.
