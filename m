From: Leon Romanovsky <leonro@nvidia.com>

Policy agents and bus drivers need a shared definition of authorization,
commitment and active trust across boot and device lifetime.

Document the admission state machine and disabled-to-authorized initrd
sequence, including built-in probes and pending work. Explain DMA domain
preparation, binding restrictions, device replacement and current userspace
integration requirements. Distinguish attestation and containment from the
permission to bind a functional driver.

+============
+Device trust
+============
+
+Device trust controls how the kernel uses a device. It does not verify the
+device's identity or firmware. Driver core tracks the requested policy,
+permission to bind, and active trust level separately.
+
+Policy and active trust
+=======================
+
+The writable ``trust_policy`` attribute accepts ``default``, ``disabled``,
+``adversary``, or ``full``. The bus may set the initial policy; otherwise it
+starts as ``default``. Boot options can override it for all devices, a
+named driver, or an individual device. See `Boot policy`_ for precedence.
+
+The read-only ``trust`` attribute reports the active trust level:
+
+``DEVICE_TRUST_DISABLED`` (``disabled``)
+  There is no active driver setup or binding. The requested policy decides
+  whether a later bind is allowed.
+
+``DEVICE_TRUST_ADVERSARY`` (``adversary``)
+  The kernel treats the device as potentially malicious. The bus and DMA
+  layers must enforce the restrictions needed to operate it.
+
+``DEVICE_TRUST_FULL`` (``full``)
+  The device uses the normal privileges allowed by the bus and DMA policy.
+
+Policy resolution
+=================
+
+A bus can implement ``bus_type::trust_resolve`` to choose the active level
+from the device, candidate driver, and requested policy. For ``default``,
+it may use topology or firmware information. Other policies must resolve
+to the matching level or fail.
+
+The callback must not enable the device or grant DMA access. Those steps
+belong in setup callbacks, after resolution and before probe.
+
+Without this callback, ``default`` and ``full`` resolve to
+``DEVICE_TRUST_FULL``, and ``adversary`` to ``DEVICE_TRUST_ADVERSARY``.
+Explicit ``disabled`` blocks binding. The bus remains responsible for
+enforcing the chosen level's restrictions.
+
+Admission and policy writes
+===========================
+
+Authorization is userspace's choice of adversary or full for a disabled
+device. Commitment happens when the kernel accepts a policy and operating
+level, before starting driver setup. Both limit later policy changes.
+
+With ``device_trust.default=full``, runtime policy changes are unavailable
+for every device, including devices with a boot policy exception. Writing
+a different policy returns ``-EBUSY``. Writing the current policy succeeds
+without changing state or suppressing a pending driver boot rule. Boot
+device and driver rules retain their precedence.
+
+In other global modes, runtime policy writes follow the internal states
+below; these are not additional sysfs values.
+``P`` is the requested policy and ``L`` is the committed operating level.
+
+.. list-table:: Admission states
+   :header-rows: 1
+   :widths: 25 40 35
+
+   * - State
+     - Meaning
+     - Policy writes
+   * - SELECTABLE
+     - The device has not been authorized or committed.
+     - Any policy is allowed. Selecting disabled enters WAITING.
+   * - WAITING
+     - Policy is disabled - no operating level is committed.
+     - Choose adversary or full to enter AUTHORIZED(P).
+   * - AUTHORIZED(P)
+     - Userspace has chosen adversary or full from WAITING.
+     - The policy cannot change, even before setup begins.
+   * - COMMITTED(P, L)
+     - The kernel has accepted P and L for setup.
+     - Neither the policy nor the operating level can change.
+
+Bus defaults and boot options set the initial state: disabled starts in
+WAITING; other policies start in SELECTABLE. Driver boot rules apply later,
+when a matching driver attempts to bind. They may still replace this
+initial state, including WAITING, unless a per-device boot entry or a
+successful policy write takes precedence.
+
+Userspace cannot move WAITING back to SELECTABLE by writing ``default``.
+Choosing adversary or full from WAITING locks that policy immediately.
+
+After boot initialization, the state transitions are::
+
+  SELECTABLE ----select disabled----> WAITING
+      |                                 |
+      |                             authorize
+      |                           adversary/full
+      |                                 |
+      |                                 v
+      |                            AUTHORIZED(P)
+      |                                 |
+      +------ permitted resolution -----+
+                       |
+                       v
+                 COMMITTED(P, L)
+
+Binding and device lifetime
+============================
+
+A manual bind that reaches WAITING returns ``-EPERM`` before driver or DMA
+setup. Automatic matching skips the rejected driver and tries the next
+candidate. Except with ``device_trust.default=full``, repeated rejected
+attempts leave the policy writable for later authorization.
+
+Active trust stays at L through DMA setup, probe, operation, removal, and
+``bus_type::dma_cleanup``. It returns to disabled only after cleanup ends.
+
+The state lasts for the device object's lifetime, including the switch
+from initrd to the root filesystem. Unbinding and rebinding a registered
+device does not reset it. A removed device cannot be registered again; a
+new object starts with bus and boot policy.
+
+Manual attachment under global full policy
+==========================================
+
+This compatibility API **must not be used in any new code**. Its
+full-only restriction prevents devices from using the device trust
+authorization infrastructure. New code must use ``device_driver_attach()``.
+
+``device_driver_attach_full()`` supports manual attachment with the
+caller's existing subsystem serialization. It requires an explicit
+``device_trust.default=full`` boot option and a policy that resolves to
+full. It returns ``-EPERM`` in every other global mode, including when
+the option is absent or set to ``default``, before calling the driver.
+
+Per-device boot exceptions still apply: disabled and adversary reject
+attachment. If a ``device_trust.driver=`` list is configured, the device
+must also have an explicit ``device_trust=`` entry; otherwise this API
+returns ``-EPERM``. That entry prevents a concurrent driver rule from
+changing the policy.
+
+The caller serializes attachment and removal. The API takes neither the
+device nor parent lock, commits full before the probe callback, and
+publishes the binding after probe succeeds. It does not perform normal
+driver-core DMA, pinctrl, or power-domain setup. A failed probe or binding
+clears active trust but retains the full commitment.
+
+Boot policy
+===========
+
+Built-in drivers can probe before userspace starts. Use boot options to
+set their initial policy. All three options accept default, disabled,
+adversary, and full.
+
+``device_trust.default=`` sets policy for all devices. If omitted or set
+to default, it preserves bus policy. Other values replace bus policy,
+including topology and removability defaults. The last valid value wins;
+invalid values are reported and ignored.
+
+``device_trust=`` sets policy for individual devices using a comma-separated
+list of ``<bus>:<device>=<policy>`` entries. Names must match
+``/sys/bus/<bus>/devices/<device>`` exactly. The first colon separates the
+bus name; later colons are part of the device name. Names cannot contain
+whitespace, control characters, commas, equals signs, or double quotes.
+Wildcards are not supported.
+
+A device entry overrides driver rules, the global setting, and bus policy,
+regardless of option order. Explicit default asks the bus or generic
+resolver to choose a level, even if the global setting is disabled. The
+last entry for a device wins. If the option is repeated, the last valid
+list replaces all earlier lists. A malformed list is ignored in full,
+with a warning.
+
+``device_trust.driver=`` sets policy by driver name using a comma-separated
+list of ``<bus>:<driver>=<policy>`` entries. Use exact names from
+``/sys/bus/<bus>/drivers/<driver>``, not module names or aliases. The name
+restrictions and list handling are the same as for device entries. The
+two lists are independent. Driver rules cover built-in drivers, modules,
+and hotplug.
+
+The first bind attempt with a matching driver rule applies it before
+resolution and setup. It overrides bus and global defaults, including
+global disabled. It cannot override a per-device entry or an existing
+authorization or commitment. A successful sysfs policy write also takes
+precedence, except for a no-op write with ``device_trust.default=full``.
+The rule applies only once per device object, even if resolution or setup
+fails.
+
+After a disabled driver rule applies, rejected probes and driver changes
+leave the device in WAITING. Userspace can authorize it unless the global
+mode is full. Before any rule applies, a driver with no matching rule may
+still bind through normal attachment. Use global or per-device disabled
+to block every driver.
+
+An initrd can hold devices with ``device_trust.default=disabled`` and use
+boot exceptions for devices and suppliers needed to reach the initrd and
+perform attestation. These exceptions allow operation before fresh initrd
+attestation. Devices without an exception stay disabled even if their bus
+would normally choose adversary or full.
+
+Global and per-device rules apply before device registration. Buses that
+need policy earlier call ``device_trust_init()`` after setting the bus,
+name, and initial policy. Driver rules apply later, when a candidate driver
+is known.
+
+All boot rules remain available for newly discovered devices. Initialize
+boot policy before device registration. These options are not runtime
+controls or proof of hardware identity.
+Disabled blocks early binding and, outside global full mode, allows later
+authorization. Adversary and full permit early binding without fresh
+initrd attestation.
+
+DMA containment
+===============
+
+Disabled blocks driver binding, not DMA that hardware starts on its own.
+The bus and IOMMU must provide containment while a device waits for
+authorization.
+
+Adversary does not require an IOMMU. Without an IOMMU group, or with IOMMU
+support compiled out, binding uses the platform's normal DMA configuration.
+Adversary policy alone does not provide DMA isolation.
+
+Binding does not check the IOMMU domain. Neither a driver rule nor a sysfs
+policy write reconfigures it. If a bus uses trust policy during DMA
+configuration, select the policy before that configuration takes place.
+A setup failure after commitment leaves the chosen mode fixed; it cannot
+fall back to full.
+
+Drivers that manage DMA themselves must provide their own containment.
+Drivers that do not use DMA need no domain.
+
+Initrd attestation sequence
+===========================
+
+For a device that uses normal driver attachment:
+
+1. Boot with ``device_trust.default=disabled`` to hold all devices, or use
+   a per-device rule to hold an individual device. Add exceptions needed
+   to reach the initrd and provide DMA containment while waiting. Disabled
+   attempts remain in WAITING, including attempts by built-in drivers.
+2. In the initrd, control probing and attest the current device through a
+   transport that works without its functional driver. Keep policy disabled
+   during verification and preparation. Leave it disabled if verification
+   fails or is unavailable. Removal or replacement invalidates the result;
+   a reused bus address is not proof of identity. Repeat attestation if a
+   reset or preparation step invalidates the evidence.
+3. Once all checks and preparation are complete, write adversary or full
+   to ``trust_policy``. This locks the choice and allows binding.
+4. Request binding through ``drivers_probe`` or another attach path. The
+   kernel commits the operating level before setup. Retries keep the same
+   policy and level. An attachment deferred before the driver's probe
+   callback returns ``-EAGAIN``; retry later. A successful write does not
+   guarantee that a driver bound, so check the device's ``driver`` link.
+
+Queued or concurrent probes may start as soon as step 3 completes, before
+step 4. Evidence must still be valid when authorizing the device.
+Boot exceptions that permit adversary or full allow early operation
+without fresh initrd attestation.
+
+The kernel interface provides neither an attestation transport nor a verifier.
+
+Driver use and independent properties
+=====================================
+
+Drivers read active trust with ``device_get_trust_level()`` or
+``device_is_adversarial()``. They may cache it while bound, but must not
+change requested policy or treat trust as proof of other security
+properties. Use the adversary check for paths that bypass the DMA API.
+General DMA containment belongs in bus and IOMMU code.
+
+Discovery code uses ``device_policy_is_adversarial()`` to check requested
+policy before binding or after unbind. This helper does not resolve
+default policy or report active trust.
+
+Code that needs the level fixed for the device's lifetime can use
+``device_get_committed_trust_level()``. It returns disabled before
+commitment and the fixed level afterwards, including after failed setup
+or unbind. It does not permit operation while unbound.
+
+Trust does not describe transport protection, encryption, verified
+identity, memory privacy, or DMA addressability. Keep these properties
+independent of the requested policy and active trust level.
+
+Policy writes cannot revoke authorization or switch an operating device
+between adversary and full. Stopping it requires a separate procedure to
+quiesce the driver, tear down DMA, and contain the device on its bus.
